Snippet: Work can be pretty taxing when it’s slow and you need to find things to do. A lot of cleaning and detailing involved. Pay is good but ever since the 20$ an hour raise hours are being cut drastically. Good place to work for a good start. Management is awesome and great to work with. They do care a lot about their employees.

Snippet: <b>Carl</b>&#39;s <b>Jr</b>.&#39;s Hand-Breaded Chicken Sandwich features a chicken breast filet dipped in buttermilk, lightly-breaded, and then deep-fried until crispy. The filet comes served with garlic pickles and mayo on a toasted potato bun. It&#39;s priced at $6.99 in my area, which is a sizeable premium compared to the $4 to $5 pricing that most new fast food chain chicken sandwiches are going for.
