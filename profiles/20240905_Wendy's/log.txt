Susan: Gathering information on 'Wendy's' will involve several stages:

1. **Company Background**: Start with a general understanding of the business. Visit their official website to understand their core values, culture, key products and services, strategies, marketing campaigns, goals, and target audience. During this phase, also look at their geographical locations, number of employees, and history, including mergers, acquisitions, and expansions.

2. **Financial Information**: Look up their public financial records. This is mainly for publicly traded companies like 'Wendy's'. These could be available on their official website under investor relations, or on financial databases like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Bloomberg, or Reuters. Check their latest quarterly and annual reports for revenue, profits, capital investments, debt, and other financial metrics. Look for market analysis reports that might shed light on their competitive positioning.

3. **Key Decision Makers**: Identify the top executives and board members. You can do this from the official company website or associated news articles. Learn about their previous roles, credentials, successes, and failures. Scan the news for any controversies or extreme stands on policy issues. Their personal or professional affiliations can be treated as possible leverage points.

4. **Labor Relations**: Search in trade publications, local newspapers, or news databases for any stories related to 'Wendy's' treatment of their employees. It may involve issues related to pay, benefits, working conditions, layoffs, strikes, or lawsuits. Look out for any recent or past protests, controversies, or notable decisions related to their workforce.

5. **Recent Scandals**: Scan news portals, social media, and press releases for recent scandals involving the company. This can include issues related to product quality, customer service, lawsuits, environmental issues, or leadership scandals.

6. **Social Media and Online Presence**: Look at Wendy's activity on all social media platforms. Identify how they interact with their customers, handle complaints, and their online reputation.

7. **Customer Reviews**: Check review sites like Yelp, Google Reviews, and Trip Advisor to understand customer feedback. These could reveal potential ethical, service, or product quality issues.

8. **Competitors and Market Environment**: Research on the key competitors and market environment to understand Wendy's positioning and strategies better. This may also reveal potential areas of vulnerability.

This information will be compiled, organized, and summarized in a brief to provide a comprehensive understanding of Wendy's as an employer.
Manny: Susan, this strategy seems comprehensive and well-structured. However, a few clarifying questions on specific points:

1. **Financial Information**: Since Wendy's is public, we can access their financial information readily. However, are there elements we should pay special attention to? We want to understand their financial health but also look for potential leverage points.

2. **Key Decision Makers**: Besides their professional background, what kind of personal information is appropriate to look for? We want to respect privacy issues as we identify potential leverage points.

3. **Labor Relations**: Besides instances of strikes or lawsuits, which might be more evident, what other indicators should we look for that might indicate less-than-ideal labor practices?

4. **Recent Scandals**: How far back should we look at when considering "recent" scandals for our report?

5. **Customer Reviews**: While these reviews provide a wealth of information about customer sentiment, they can be quite subjective and potentially manipulated. How should we approach analyzing these reviews?

6. **Competitors and Market Environment**: Could you suggest some direct competitors of Wendy's we should include in our research for comparison? 

Your clarification on these points will assist greatly as we develop our research brief. Thanks!
