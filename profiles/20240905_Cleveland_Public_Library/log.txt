Susan: 1. **Summarize Financial Information**: Find audited financial statements, annual reports, and funding sources, all often available on an organization's website. Prioritize revenues, expenditures, outstanding debts, and assets. Also, check the state's Secretary of State or comparable department, which may have financial records available for public entities.

2. **Key Decision Makers**: Examine the library's official website and reports for the names and roles of the Board of Trustees, Executive Team, or any other key decision makers. Google these individuals to find relevant information, such as professional background, professional networks, and any other relevant personal information like philanthropic or political activities. Public records databases and LinkedIn can be invaluable in this phase.

3. **Labor Relations**: Seek out information on any labor disputes, collective bargaining agreements, or union activity involving the library. Look for local news articles, union websites, or public records filed with the state's labor board.

4. **Recent Scandals**: Scour reputable newspapers and websites for scandals involving the library or its decision-makers. Look for financial impropriety, labor disputes, or controversial actions or statements.

5. **Other Points of Leverage**: Review public reviews and comments about the library on platforms like Yelp, Google Reviews, Facebook, and Twitter, or local news sites. This could reveal dissatisfaction among the public/services users that could be leveraged.

Remember, research may not turn up useful information right away, but persistence and a systematic approach can yield valuable insights.
Manny: Thanks for sharing the strategy, Susan. I have few follow-up questions:

1. **Financial Information**: Can we identify any databases or online resources that are most reliable for obtaining financial information on public entities?

2. **Key Decision Makers**: In addition to professional background and networks, what other personal information can be helpful, and ethical, to gather about key decision-makers?

3. **Labor Relations**: Which local newspapers or websites do you find most useful for revealing labor disputes or union activity?

4. **Scandals**: What should be our standard for considering a scandal 'notable'?

5. **Other Points of Leverage**: What kind of public dissatisfaction tends to be most effective as leverage? Are there any specific signs we should look for in reviews or comments? 

Revisiting these points will fine-tune our approach to better the research.
