Susan: Sure, follow this step-by-step approach for researching 'Dave and Buster's':

1. **Company Overview**: Start by visiting the company's official website to gain a basic understanding. Check out sections like 'About Us', 'Our Team', 'News' or 'Press Releases' for valuable information. 

2. **Financial Information**: Next, find out about their financial status. Check sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance or Bloomberg for their financial statements, stock performance, and major shareholders. Look out for any trends, elements of instability, or potential weaknesses that could be used as leverage points.

3. **Decision Makers**: Identify the key decision-makers in the company by looking at their 'Management Team' or 'Executive Team' section on the company's website. Once you've identified them, conduct individual searches for each person, focusing on social media networks like LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as news articles, for any useful information.

4. **Labor Relations & Notable News**: Check national and local news outlets for articles about Dave and Buster's labor relations. Look for any issues related to wages, layoffs, collective bargaining, or workplace conditions. Websites or forums like Glassdoor provide employees' views on the company culture. 

5. **Legal Issues & Scandals**: For this, use Google and search for any lawsuits or legal controversies involving the company. You can use search terms like 'Dave and Buster's + lawsuit', 'Dave and Buster's + controversy', or 'Dave and Buster's + scandal'.

6. **Company Policies**: Review their policies, especially HR related. See if there is any of that information available publicly that can provide insight into their labor practices.

7. **Competitor Analysis**: Look at the company's main competitors (like other food and entertainment chains) and how Dave and Buster's is performing in comparison.

8. **Public Opinion**: Lastly, look at social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and online forums to understand how the public currently views the company.

Remember, always cross-verify the information from different sources to increase the reliability of your data.
