Susan: Certainly. To approach gathering information for a research brief on Walmart, here's a step-by-step plan using resources available on the open web:

1. **Company Website & Official Reports:** Start with Walmart's official website to get basic details about the company. Look for their annual report (usually in the investor's relation section) to get an understanding of their overall financial situation. You should find a goldmine of data in their annual reports, such as financial statements, executive compensation, major merger and acquisition activity, operational highlights, and future strategy.

2. **Key Decision Makers:** Use resources like Bloomberg or Forbes to identify the key players in the organization like the CEO, Board of Directors, and key shareholders. Leverage platforms like LinkedIn or corporate biography entries to gather more detailed information about their past experience, public sentiment, and potential points of leverage.

3. **Company News:** Use news outlets like Business Insider, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, or Forbes for articles related to Walmart. Look out for insights on company's labor relations, market performance, expansion plans, recent scandals, or anything that can provide possible points of leverage.

4. **Labor Relations:** Utilize resources from the Department of Labor to understand Walmart's labor relations history. Look for information regarding strikes, wage disputes, discrimination lawsuits, and issues regarding working conditions.

5. **Public Perception:** Use social media platforms (like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) to understand public perception and employee sentiment about the company. Websites like Glassdoor or Indeed can provide an inside perspective from employees working at different levels within the company.

6. **Competitor Analysis:** Examining major competitors can also provide context for understanding how Walmart operates within its industry. Websites like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance can assist in comparing financial data.

7. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Issues:** Consider reviewing any ESG reports or ratings that Walmart might have. These can provide information about their sustainability efforts or lack therof, as well as other potential reputational risks.

8. **Local News:** Local newspapers can provide unique perspectives on Walmart’s interactions with local communities. This could include contention related to store openings, local government issues, employment practices, and other local disputes.

Remember to document all your findings thoroughly with appropriate annotation to their sources. You can use tools like OneNote, Google Keep or Evernote for this purpose. This will allow the research team to retrieve the information and perform a deep dive when necessary.
