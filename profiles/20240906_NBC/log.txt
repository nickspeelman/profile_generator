Susan: Sure, here is a suggested strategy for gathering information on NBC.

1. **Company Overview:** Start by visiting the official NBC website and corporate portfolio sites (like NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast Corporation) to understand the company structure and its key activities. Look for annual reports, sustainability reports, investor presentations, and any other corporate publications that may provide useful information.

2. **Financial Information:** Examine NBC's financial information. Since NBC is a part of the publicly traded Comcast Corporation, financial data should be readily available. Look for the financial reports on the company's investor relations page which generally provides annual and quarterly reports. Also, financial news sites like Bloomberg, MarketWatch, and Yahoo Finance can provide recent financial news and performance indicators like stock prices, revenues, and profits.

3. **Key Decision Makers:** To find key decision makers, check the 'About Us' or 'Management Team' section of the company's website. Look for possible points of leverage like affiliations, memberships, past controversies, or connections that the decision makers might have outside of the company. Additionally, try to locate their profiles on professional networks like LinkedIn.

4. **Labor Relations:** Look for recent news around labor disputes, strikes or other labor actions, union negotiations, and labor law violations. You can leverage search engines and news websites for this, typing in keywords like "NBC labor relations" or "NBC union news." Also, check websites of labor unions that NBC employees could be part of for any ongoing issues or past disputes. 

5. **Recent Scandals and Controversies:** Look for scandals or controversies related to NBC by searching on news aggregation websites and typing "NBC controversy" or "NBC scandal" as keywords. Check any negative press coverage or criticism about the company's practices or products.

6. **Legal Information:** Check if any lawsuits have been filed by or against NBC. Public companies in the US are required to disclose certain legal disputes to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You can find these filings on the SEC's EDGAR database. 

7. **Employer Reviews:** Websites like Glassdoor and Indeed allow employees and former employees to review companies. These reviews may provide insight into internal issues, employee satisfaction, and overall company culture.

8. **Online Monitoring:** Lastly, set up Google Alerts for "NBC," allowing you to receive the latest web results, news, articles, blogs, or research directly to your email.

Taken together, this strategy will allow us to gather a comprehensive view of NBC's financial standing, leadership, labor relations, recent controversies, and more.
