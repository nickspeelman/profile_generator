Susan: Here are the steps we should follow to gather information:

1. **Company Overview:** Start with understanding the basic overview of Springfield Regional Medical Center including their history, vision, mission, and core business areas. This could be obtained from their official website, local newspaper archives or industry specific online databases.

2. **Financial Information**: Look into their financial health which includes analyzing their revenue, net income, operational costs, capital investments and more. Such information can be found in public records, press releases, annual reports if they're publicly held, and business news articles. 

3. **Key Decision Makers**: Identify their board of directors, CEO, CFO, and other key executives. LinkedIn is a powerful tool to find detailed profiles of these people, along with interview snippets, articles, etc. Understand their backgrounds, track records, professional affiliations, and potential conflicts of interest.

4. **Labor Relations**: Research their stance on labor unions and current labor relations. Look into the presence of any labor unions, the nature of their contracts, any previous or ongoing labor disputes, strikes, wage disputes, etc. News sources, court records, and industry journals could have this information.

5. **Recent Scandals or Controversies**: Look for any recent scandals, lawsuits, or controversies that have affected the company. These can be found on newspaper databases, industry forums, and sometimes on the company's Wikipedia page.

6. **Points of Leverage**: Points of leverage could be identified from the above information. Weak financials, forthcoming contractual renewals with labor unions, key decision makers with controversial histories, recent scandals or legal battles, etc. can all be potential leverage points.

7. **Other Relevant Information**: This could include any upcoming legislation or policy changes that could affect the company, shifts in their industry or market, significant new competitors, or other external factors that could present leverage opportunities.

Remember, all this data collection should be conducted ethically, using only publically available sources, respecting privacy laws and norms.
