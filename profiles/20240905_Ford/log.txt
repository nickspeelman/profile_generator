Susan: Here are some steps that can be followed to gather information about Ford:

1. **Company's official website and Annual Reports:** Start with Ford's official website and explore sections like "About us", "Investor Relations", "Financial Reports", etc., which offer useful insights about the company's operations, financial status, strategic directions, leadership, and business priorities. The company's annual reports, quarterly calls, and other financial communications can provide detailed financial information, key strategic initiatives, product plans and management discussions. 

2. **Company Leaders Profiles:** To identify the key decision-makers in the company, look into the "Leadership" or "Executive Team" section of the Ford website. After identifying the key decision makers, expand your search on these individuals to understand their professional background, viewpoints and any potential points of leverage. Useful sources could be their LinkedIn profiles, recent interviews, speeches, or articles. 

3. **News Outlets and Industry Publications:** For gaining information on recent news on labor relations, scandals, and other points of leverage, follow news concerning Ford on reliable outlets like Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Insider, etc. Likewise, automotive industry publications and forums could offer news on vehicle recalls, labor issues, etc. 

4. **Labor Union Publications:** Look into labor union publications for information on recent labor disputes or negotiations involving Ford. Websites of unions like UAW can contain press statements or articles that can shed light on labor relations within Ford.

5. **Social Media:** Monitor Ford's official social media pages, mentions, hashtags, etc. on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. This could also provide timely information on recent developments, promotional strategies, customer feedback, and potential issues.

6. **Consumer and Employee review platforms:** Websites like Glassdoor for reviews from current and former employees, or consumer review platforms can give a sense of company culture, labor conditions, and product quality.

7. **Regulatory Bodies:** Check updates or undertakings related to Ford from bodies like the National Labor Relations Board, Environmental Protection Agency for any enforcement action or lawsuits.

8. **Databases:** Use databases like Bloomberg or Reuters for market data, financials, or analysis. Academic databases like JSTOR or business-focused resources like Harvard Business Review may provide macro or micro level context on challenges and opportunities faced by Ford in different markets.

Finally, consolidate and analyze collected information to prepare a detailed, nuanced research brief.
