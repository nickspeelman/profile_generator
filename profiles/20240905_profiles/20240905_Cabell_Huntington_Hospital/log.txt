Research Topic: Cabell Huntington Hospital
Susan: Sure, here is our strategy to gather information on Cabell Huntington Hospital:

1. **Basic Financial Information:** Start with open databases like Dun & Bradstreet or PrivCo, government or nonprofit organized databases such as the health department or National Council of Nonprofits, and the hospital's official website for financial information. This could include total revenues, major sources of funding, and personnel costs. 

2. **Key Decision Makers:** Visit professional social networks like LinkedIn and the hospital's website 'About Us' or 'Leadership' section to identify key decision makers. These could include the CEO, CFO, COO, and other top-level executives. We also want to look for the Board of Directors. Once we have some names, we can search more about them, looking for any public details that might show influence or pressure points.

3. **Labor Relations Information:** Look on websites for labor unions related to the healthcare industry, such as National Nurses United or SEIU. Look for any press releases, news, or recent negotiations involving the hospital. In addition, regulatory agencies' websites might include information about any labor disputes or other issues. 

4. **Recent Scandals:** Search news outlet websites, local newspapers, industry publication websites or databases. Pay attention to anything related to labor disputes, financial irregularities, or malpractice.

5. **Additional Leverage Points:** Assess public perspectives about the hospital via customer review sites; try to analyze sentiment towards the hospital and its practices. Browse forums like Reddit or Glassdoor for current and former employee sentiment. We can also evaluate the hospital's commitments to certain issues like environmental sustainability or community health and see if they are living up to their claims.

6. **Charitable Contributions and Sponsorships:** Nonprofit hospitals like Cabell Huntington Hospital often make charitable contributions or sponsor local events. Understanding these relationships could provide additional leverage.

Remember, the objective is to paint a holistic picture of the hospital’s financial health, leadership, labor relations, and public image. This can help identify potential pressure points-utilizable in future negotiations.
Manny: Great, thank you for organizing it. Here are some follow up questions for Susan: 

1. **On Basic Financial Information:** Do we have access to databases like Dun & Bradstreet or PrivCo for financial information? Or should we rely only on public sources like the health department or National Council of Nonprofits and the hospital's official website?

2. **On Key Decision Makers:** Beyond LinkedIn and the hospital's official website, are there any other reliable public sources to determine and verify key decision makers, such as registries or industry-specific directories?

3. **On Labor Relations Information:** How can we ensure that the labor relations information we find is current and reliable? Are there ways of cross verifying this information?

4. **On Recent Scandals:** How far back should we go in terms of checking for scandals? Is there a particular timeline that's most relevant?

5. **On Additional Leverage Points:** When evaluating public sentiment, how can we ensure our analysis is balanced and not skewed by outliers? 

6. **On Charitable Contributions and Sponsorships:** How can we confirm that the money that Cabell Huntington Hospital donates or sponsors is used as they claim?

Please provide some guidance on these points, Susan.
