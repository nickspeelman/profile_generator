Research Topic: Chucke E. Cheese
Susan: Certainly, I would recommend these following steps for researching about Chuck E. Cheese:

1. **Start with the website of Chuck E. Cheese:** It will provide the company's information, its mission, vision, values, annual reports, financial disclosures, press releases, and maybe some brief information about key decision makers. This can help us learn about their business model, fundamental purposes, and important events.

2. **Look at key decision makers:** Check the website's "About Us" and "Team" sections for details about the key employees and their roles. For more detailed information, check their LinkedIn profiles. There you can find data related to their professional background, interests, networking and if possible, their recent activities or posts which might help us understand their viewpoints on specific matters. 

3. **Analyze financial status:** Use public financial documents available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR platform. Here, you can find in-depth financial information about the company that can be useful for financial analysis. Look at annual reports, statements of cash flows, and SEC filings to get a complete understanding of the financial health and stability of the company.

4. **Research Media Coverage:** Google News provides abundant resources for identifying how the company is portrayed in the media. Search for articles about labor disputes, lawsuits, boycotts, public scandals, or conflicts with unions, which can provide additional leverage points.

5. **Review Social Media:** Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram can provide insight into the public perception of the company, as well as any ongoing issues. Monitor what people are saying about the company's labor practices and how the company interacts with its audience.

6. **Check Glassdoor and Indeed:** These sites can provide insight into the company's labor practices, culture, management style, and employee satisfaction. 

7. **Look into Industry Reports:** Use industry resources, research firms, or trade publications to gather additional data about the company's performance, competitiveness, market share, etc.

Once we've gathered the information, we will consolidate our findings to provide an overview of the company's financial health, its key decision makers, labor relation news, and any other points of leverage.
Manny: Thank you for summarizing Susan's strategy. Here are some follow-up questions we could ask:

1. **Could you provide more detail on how to analyze the company's financial status?:** It would be useful to gather more specifics on which financial metrics to focus on, for instance, revenue trends, net income, cash flow, and debt levels. Also, we could ask her for any tips on interpreting the SEC filings.

2. **How do we gauge public perception through social media?:** She mentioned that Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram may offer insights into public perception. I would like her to delve more into this. What should we specifically look for in social media activities and interactions?

3. **Can we identify any labor union affiliations from our research?:** Can she suggest any specific signs or indications that may suggest whether the companyâ€™s employees are part of a union?

4. **When looking at key decision-makers, are we only considering top leadership?:** Should we also consider individuals in roles related to labor relations, HR, or operational managers who might impact labor practices?

5. **How do we use the information we find on Glassdoor and Indeed?:** What specifics should we consider from employee reviews, ratings, and feedback and how much weightage should they have?

Let's get these questions over to Susan so we can refine our strategy.
