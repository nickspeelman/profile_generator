Research Topic: Beeghly Oaks Nursing Home
Susan: Sure, to gather information pertaining to Beeghly Oaks Nursing Home, we should follow a detailed strategy covering different aspects of the organization. 

1. **Financial Information:**
   Start with an internet search to find any publicly available financial information. Websites such as Glassdoor, Bloomberg, or Indeed might provide general insight into their revenue, profitability, and financial stability. 

2. **Key Decision Makers:** 
   Investigate the nursing home's official website to identify the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other key leadership roles. Use LinkedIn and the web to research their background, professional network, and any potential points of leverage, such as history of labor relations, notable achievements, or controversies.

3. **Labor Relations:** 
   Look for any news articles, labor dispute records, or reviews from workers or former employees about their working conditions. Websites like Indeed, Glassdoor or union websites could provide essential insights on this.

4. **Recent Scandals:**
   A comprehensive web search can help locate any recent scandals or negative news coverage. Look at local news outlets, blogs, and social media posts relating to the nursing home, focusing on incidents that could potentially undermine their reputation or credibility.

5. **Laws and Regulations:**
   Understanding laws and regulations in the care home sector can help locate potential points of compliance leverage. Are there any regulatory changes that could impact their operations? Have they been penalized in the past for lack of compliance?

6. **Public Perception:**
   Check their standing in the community through online reviews and discussions on platforms like Google Maps, Yelp, and Facebook. A negative public image, if it exists, can be a significant point of leverage.

7. **Partnerships and Affiliations:**
   Identify any corporations or health institutions affiliated with Beeghly Oaks. Potential issues with these partners could indirectly impact Beeghly too.

Remember, all data collected through this process must be approached ethically, and used responsibly.
