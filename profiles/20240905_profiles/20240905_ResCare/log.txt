Research Topic: ResCare
Susan: Sure, I'd suggest a five-pronged approach to gather information on 'ResCare':

1. **Company Overview**: Visit ResCare's website for an overview of the company. This includes understanding its products or services, the geographic area where it operates, its mission and values, etc. You may also want to make note of the parent organization, BrightSpring Health Services. Review their official communications, press releases, annual and quarterly reports if available.

2. **Key Decision Makers and Stakeholders**: Look for ResCare’s ‘Leadership’ or ‘Team’ section in the site to identify the key players. Search for these individuals on professional networking sites like LinkedIn to understand their background, previous roles, achievements, and more. Also, identify the major shareholders of the company who could influence business decisions.

3. **Financial Overview**: Using financial news platforms and databases like Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, you can get insight into ResCare’s financial health, including sales revenue, profit margins, acquisitions, and more.

4. **Labor Relations**: Visit labor law resources, union forums, employee review sites like Glassdoor to gain insights into labor relations at ResCare. See if the company has had any major labor disputes, strikes, cases related to workplace safety, discrimination, or other similar issues recently. You can also review the National Labor Relations Board's database for any allegations against the company.

5. **Recent Scandals or Controversies**: Execute a thorough search of ResCare's history on news websites, including local newspapers and national outlets. Look for any evidence of recent scandals, controversies, lawsuits, or regulatory problems. Check the company's ratings and reviews on consumer forums and business review sites, for any patterns of concerns that might be useful for negotiations. 

Remember to triangulate the information gathered from multiple sources for credibility and make sure you're working with the most accurate and up-to-date data available.
Manny: Here are a few follow-up questions we should ask:

1. **Methodology for Information Validation**: How do we ensure the information gathered is accurate, relevant, and current? Can you suggest a process for validation and verification?

2. **Tools and Resources**: Besides the resources mentioned, are there any other specialized tools, databases, or subscriptions that might help us in our research?

3. **Key Financial Indicators**: What specific financial indicators should we pay special attention to in the case of a company like ResCare? 

4. **Labor Law Regulations**: What specific labor laws and regulations should we be mindful of while reviewing potential labor disputes or issues? 

5. **Scandal Impact**: If we find any scandals, how can we gauge or measure their impact on the company's reputation or financials? 

6. **Information Compilation and Presentation**: Do we have a specific format or template for presenting the information in a concise yet comprehensive way? 

Susan, can you help provide detailed answers to these questions?

```python
