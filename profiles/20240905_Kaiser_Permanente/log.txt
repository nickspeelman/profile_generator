Susan: 1. **Company Website:** Start by reviewing Kaiser Permanente's official website. You can find crucial information on their mission statement, company values, leadership team, and any significant news or updates.

2. **Financial Reports:** Publicly available financial reports and statements can be useful in understanding the company's financial health and scenario. Look for annual reports, quarterly reports, investor presentations, and earnings call transcripts. Websites such as Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and Google Finance may provide access to these.

3. **Corporate Leadership:** Identify key decision-makers in Kaiser Permanente. This information is typically available within the 'Leadership' or 'Team' page of the organizational website. LinkedIn is also a valuable resource for this information as you can use it to provide a broader picture of the individuals' career trajectories, network affiliacies, and perhaps even possible points of leverage.

4. **Union Publications and Affiliations**: Investigate whether Kaiser Permanente has any previous or ongoing connections with labor unions. Websites of labor unions, media articles, press releases, and legal databases can provide details about any interactions, disputes, or collaborations.

5. **News and Media Coverage:** Recent news articles can provide insights into the company's current actions, its public reputation, and any recent scandals. News aggregators like Google News can be useful tools for this, as well as industry-specific news sites.

6. **Legal Filings and Court Records:** Investigate potential legal issues or complaints leveled at the company. Court records, if publicly available, may reveal patterns of behavior that could be useful in labor negotiations. 

7. **Social Media:** Social media offers real-time updates on companies. Follow Kaiser Permanent on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Also, look at employee reviews on websites like Glassdoor and Indeed to gauge employee sentiment about working conditions, management, and labor relations.

8. **Industry Reports and Competitor Analysis:** Review industry reports for a more comprehensive view of their business environment and competitor behaviors.

Remember, it is crucial to filter the relevant information and faithfully cite sources in briefs. Double-check facts and verify from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
