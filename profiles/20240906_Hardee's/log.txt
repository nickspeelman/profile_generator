Susan: Approaching such a research task would require deliberate, sequential efforts that cover different aspects of the task. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of an efficient strategy for our research on 'Hardee's'.

1. **Overview and Background Information**: Initiate by collecting general information about Hardee's. This information should provide a comprehensive picture of the company, including its history, mission, values, organizational structure, and size. Rely on resources like the company's website, Wikipedia, and business directories.

2. **Financial Information Analysis**: The next focus would be on the company's financial health. Look into various financial data, including revenue, profits, and debts. Sources for this information may include company annual reports (if publicly available), financial news websites, and industry reports.

3. **Understanding Key Decision Makers**: Identify the top management and board of directors of Hardee's. They would be the most influential people in the company, and understanding their professional background, personal interests, network, and public statements could provide possible points of leverage. LinkedIn, the company's website, business news outlets, and public databases can be helpful for this.

4. **Labor Relations Scan**: Investigate how Hardee's treats its employees. Instances of labor strikes, lawsuits, employee reviews, retaliation against unionization, wage issues, or violations of labor laws can provide significant leverage in negotiations. Sites like Glassdoor, Indeed, news articles, and legal databases could offer relevant information.

5. **Recent Scandals and Controversies**: Look for any recent scandals, controversial policies, or negative publicity involving Hardee's. Any negative press can be a leverage point in our negotiation strategy. This information can be found in news outlets, blogs, and social media.

6. **Industry, Legal and Competitive Environment**: Research Hardee's competitive environment, the fast-food industry trends, and any significant legal or regulatory challenges. Such knowledge will be useful to understand Hardee's strategic approach and potential vulnerabilities. Industry analyses, news items, and business publication features would be invaluable here.

7. **Social Media and Public Perception**: Finally, studying Hardee's public perception can provide subtle insights into the company's strengths and weaknesses. Analyze customer opinions, ratings, and reviews on social media platforms and sites like Yelp, alongside sentiment analysis on Twitter and Facebook.

Remember to compile all these insights into an organized brief that summarizes the status of Hardee's, its key decision makers, financial health, labor relations, scandals, and public perception.
