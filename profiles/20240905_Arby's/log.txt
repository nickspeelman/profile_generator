Susan: To conduct a comprehensive research on Arby's, we need to gather information across several key dimensions: the company's financial status, key decision makers, labor relations, recent scandals, and other potential points of leverage. Here's a step-by-step strategy to gather these details.

1. **Financial Information:** Start by researching Arby's financials from their parent company Inspire Brands' annual and quarterly reports which are available online. Also, look for news articles that discuss Arby's or Inspire Brands' financial performance. Relevant websites here might be Forbes, Bloomberg, and Reuters. This could cover Arby's sales, net revenue, profit margin, market share, and other significant financial indicators.

2. **Key Decision Makers:** Look up Arby's executive team on their official website or LinkedIn to identify key decision makers. These could be their CEO, CFO, COO, and other executives. Once identified, research each person using news sites, social media networks, and professional networking sites for points of leverage. This could include their career backgrounds, private interests, or recent public statements.

3. **Labor Relations:** Dig into sites like Glassdoor, PayScale, and Indeed to understand the experience of the employees working at Arby's. Look for information related to salaries, benefits, workplace culture, and other indicators of employee satisfaction. Pay particular attention to any signs of discontent or conflict and check for any past or ongoing labor union activities. 

4. **Recent Scandals:** For recent controversies and scandals, news outlets and social media platforms will be invaluable. Look for recent news involving Arby's or Inspire Brands. Also, try to find out if there's been any legal action against the company. 

5. **Other Points of Leverage:** Research any recent CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives that Arby's may have undertaken, check for any potential supply chain vulnerabilities, consumer opinion about the brand (positive or negative), and examine their competitive positioning in the fast food industry. Check platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook for customer sentiments.

Remember to validate information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, relevance, and reliability. Once all these data points have been collected, we can create a detailed research brief, including potential strategies and suggestion points to engage in a dialogue with Arby's.
Manny: Susan, you provided a thorough plan; thank you. Here are a couple of follow-up questions:

1. For the key decision-makers, in addition to career backgrounds and recent public statements, do you recommend researching their communication styles, leadership philosophies or charitable endeavors? Could these serve as other potential points of leverage?

2. In understanding labor relations, should we engage with any existing or former employees on social media or professional networking sites for firsthand accounts of their experiences?

3. While tracking recent scandals, should we put a system in place to continuously monitor the web for any future scandals or negative news? What tools or techniques would you recommend for this?

4. Your point about examining the competitive positioning in the fast-food industry is pertinent. Do you suggest also looking at the strategies of comparable competitors to identify any industry vulnerabilities or trends we might otherwise overlook?

5. When gathering customer sentiment data from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook, how can we ensure what we gather is representative and not skewed by the platform’s user demographics?
Manny: Certainly, here is a Python list of search queries that Remi can perform:

```python
search_queries_for_remi = [
    "Arby's financial performance",
    "Inspire Brands annual report",
    "Inspire Brands quarterly report",

]
```
She can adjust these queries as needed to pull more targeted results.
