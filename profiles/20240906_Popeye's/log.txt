Susan: 1. Company Profile: Begin by researching the basic company profile. This will include its mission, size (including number of employees and locations), and business structure (whether it's an individually owned entity, franchised, or part of a larger corporate structure). Also, verify its retail, distribution, and operational structures.

2. Financial Information: Visit financial websites such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance to gather financial information. Look for recent financial reports as they can help determine the company's current financial status and give an idea about their profitability, debt level, and financial viability. This could provide leverage in negotiations.

3. Key Decision Makers: Research major players within the company. Find out who the CEO is, the Board of Directors, as well as the heads of important departments. LinkedIn and the company's website are useful resources for this. Gathering background information on their past business decisions, public statements and potential business connections could be used as leverage.

4. Labor Relations: Look for any stories or articles concerning Popeye's labor relations. Find out what unions they work with, any notable strikes or protests, previous labor disputes, and any evidence of worker mistreatment.

5. Recent Scandals: Utilize online news outlets and search for Popeye's recent controversies or scandals. This could include anything from food safety incidents, unethical business practices, discrimination lawsuits, etc. 

6. Regulatory Documents: Check national and local government regulatory bodies for any violations, fines, or warnings issued to the company.

7. Public Sentiment: Use social media platforms and review websites to study the public perception of the company. Look for common complaints or praises. Investigate whether there are any trends or widely shared concerns that customers or employees have about the company.

8. Competitor Analysis: Research Popeye's competitors to identify weaknesses or opportunities that the company may face. 

These angles, when properly researched, should provide a detailed analysis of relevant details about Popeye's, which can be used to devise strategic recommendations.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.,[6] also known as Popeyes and formerly named Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits[7] and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits,[8] is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants formed in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. As of 2021, Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants,[2] which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide.[citation needed] About 50 locations are company-owned; the other ~98% are franchised.[9]
History
Popeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as "Chicken on the Run".[6][10] Owner Al Copeland (1944–2008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken,[11] but his restaurant failed after several months.[6][11] Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken.[11] By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken.[11] Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985.[6] B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.[citation needed]
By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's.[14] AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479, and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol AFCE.[15] On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.[citation needed]
On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.[16]
On January 21, 2014, AFC was renamed as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and its NASDAQ ticker symbol was changed to PLKI.
On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.[17]
Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion.[18] On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[19]
Name
Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film The French Connection,[20][21] which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor.[22]
However, the company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye & Pals children's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.[citation needed]
The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years.[22] In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.[23]
The name is spelled "Popeyes", without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Hardee's. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was "too poor" to afford an apostrophe.[20]
Products
Popeyes mild chicken
Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni & cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entrées such as shrimp and catfish.[24] On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end.[25] On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets.[26] For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered "Sweet and Crunchy" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading.[27] In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.[28]
Chicken sandwich
Popeyes Chicken Sandwich (Spicy)
Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes.[29][30] The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.[29]
The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's.[31][32] Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich.[33] The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch.[34] Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines,[35] and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich.[36] Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.[37] On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country.[38] One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be "hustled out of money", making Popeyes guilty of "false advertising" along with "deceptive business practices".[39] On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.[40] Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.[41] A single sandwich contains 700 calories (2,900 J), 42 grams (1.5 oz) of fat, 14 grams (0.49 oz) of saturated fat, 1,443 milligrams (22.27 gr) of sodium, and 28 net grams of protein.[citation needed]
In September 2020, Popeyes' chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.[42]
Style and marketing

The restaurants' exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark "Love That Chicken" jingle[43] sung by New Orleans funk and R&B musician Dr. John.
In 2009, Popeyes introduced "Annie the Chicken Queen", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry.[44] The character is meant to be "honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. "Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what Annie is all about", Lynch said.[45]
Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races,[46][47] while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season.[48] In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway,[49] and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year's Truck Series season finale at Homestead–Miami Speedway.[50]
Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably "Love that chicken from Popeyes".[51][52]
International franchises

Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.
Popeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor;[53][54][55] it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019.[56][57] Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020,[58] and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico[59] and the United Kingdom,[60] with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021.[61] Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.[62][63] The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.
In December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.[64][65] In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022.[66] In January 2022, Popeyes Signed an agreement with South Korean Tuna Supplier Shilla International to open again in South Korea, the first one opened in January 2023.
Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.[67]
In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested £50 million into Popeyes UK.[68][69][70] In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year.[71][72] It forced a small fish and chip shop called Popeye's Takeaways in Feilding, New Zealand to change its name although the shop does not sell fried chicken.[73][74]

The History of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen
Popeyes didn’t grow into the number one chicken chain in the U.S. overnight; fans of our famous Louisiana-style chicken grew to Love That Chicken from Popeyes in the years following the launch of our brand in 1972.
Y’all, Popeyes has been feeding hungry guests our famous Louisiana-style chicken for a while now, and it’s been a long journey since the first Popeyes in New Orleans introduced locals with a mouth-watering menu of authentic Cajun and Creole-influenced southern cooking.
This is the story of how Popeyes grew from a single restaurant in the south to chicken chain loved across the world.
Humble beginnings
When entrepreneur Alvin C. Copeland Sr. opened the first Popeyes in the New Orleans suburb of Arabi back in 1972, he did it under a different name: Chicken on the Run. With a menu of traditional Southern-fried chicken, the restaurant struggled initially to attract customers or make its mark.
Copeland, however, was not deterred. Inspired by Cajun-cooking and his ambition to create fried chicken guests would love, he went back to the drawing board, creating a chicken recipe that gave guests a little kick of spice.
He reopened his restaurant as “Popeyes” — named for Gene Hackman’s hard-boiled police detective Popeye Doyle from the 1971 film The French Connection — and started serving the authentic New Orleans-style spicy chicken that is famous today.
Early Popeyes Food Spreads
Business heats up
The first Popeyes franchise restaurant opened in Louisiana in 1976 and started gaining a following for hometown inspired flavors. As business started to grow, Popeyes got fans singing about our chicken and introduced the famous “Love that Chicken” slogan and jingle in 1980, an iconic tune that is still spreading chicken-joy to this day.
But you can’t have a homegrown Louisiana meal without some sides, and Popeyes was about to serve up a classic. In 1983, Popeyes introduced buttermilk biscuits, and they quickly became almost as widely cherished as our chicken.
Popeyes goes global
Over the ensuing decades, Popeyes began to bring the famous flavors of New Orleans beyond all borders.
In 1984, Popeyes expanded to Toronto, Canada, marking our first international location. The next year, Popeyes opened its 500th restaurant, making it the No. 3 quick-service chicken chain based on units sold.
Popeyes was eventually bought by Restaurant Brands International in 2017, and our rapid growth and expansion has continued since. Popeyes has become one of the most beloved and successful quick-service restaurants in the world, with more than 3,800 restaurants globally
Popeyes continues to evolve
Even after Popeyes had earned the place as one of the world’s top quick-service restaurants, we didn’t stop evolving our menu.
Popeyes introduced a host of popular new culinary creations over the years, including the Wicked Chicken, Cane Sweeeet Iced Tea, Butterfly Shrimp Tackle Box, Rip'n Chick'n, Blackened Tenders, Chicken Waffle Tenders, Beer Can Chicken, and more.
And while our rich history has made the famous chicken we’re known for today, we are still crafting new delicious dishes our guests will love for years to come.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.,[6] also known as Popeyes and formerly named Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits[7] and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits,[8] is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants formed in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. As of 2021, Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants,[2] which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide.[citation needed] About 50 locations are company-owned; the other ~98% are franchised.[9]
History
Popeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as "Chicken on the Run".[6][10] Owner Al Copeland (1944–2008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken,[11] but his restaurant failed after several months.[6][11] Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken.[11] By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken.[11] Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985.[6] B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.[citation needed]
By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's.[14] AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479, and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol AFCE.[15] On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.[citation needed]
On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.[16]
On January 21, 2014, AFC was renamed as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and its NASDAQ ticker symbol was changed to PLKI.
On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.[17]
Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion.[18] On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[19]
Name
Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film The French Connection,[20][21] which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor.[22]
However, the company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye & Pals children's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.[citation needed]
The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years.[22] In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.[23]
The name is spelled "Popeyes", without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Hardee's. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was "too poor" to afford an apostrophe.[20]
Products
Popeyes mild chicken
Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni & cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entrées such as shrimp and catfish.[24] On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end.[25] On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets.[26] For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered "Sweet and Crunchy" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading.[27] In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.[28]
Chicken sandwich
Popeyes Chicken Sandwich (Spicy)
Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes.[29][30] The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.[29]
The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's.[31][32] Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich.[33] The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch.[34] Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines,[35] and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich.[36] Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.[37] On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country.[38] One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be "hustled out of money", making Popeyes guilty of "false advertising" along with "deceptive business practices".[39] On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.[40] Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.[41] A single sandwich contains 700 calories (2,900 J), 42 grams (1.5 oz) of fat, 14 grams (0.49 oz) of saturated fat, 1,443 milligrams (22.27 gr) of sodium, and 28 net grams of protein.[citation needed]
In September 2020, Popeyes' chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.[42]
Style and marketing
Coleslaw from Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen
The restaurants' exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark "Love That Chicken" jingle[43] sung by New Orleans funk and R&B musician Dr. John.
In 2009, Popeyes introduced "Annie the Chicken Queen", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry.[44] The character is meant to be "honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. "Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what Annie is all about", Lynch said.[45]
Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races,[46][47] while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season.[48] In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway,[49] and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year's Truck Series season finale at Homestead–Miami Speedway.[50]
Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably "Love that chicken from Popeyes".[51][52]
International franchises

Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.
Popeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor;[53][54][55] it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019.[56][57] Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020,[58] and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico[59] and the United Kingdom,[60] with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021.[61] Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.[62][63] The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.
In December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.[64][65] In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022.[66] In January 2022, Popeyes Signed an agreement with South Korean Tuna Supplier Shilla International to open again in South Korea, the first one opened in January 2023.
Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.[67]
In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested £50 million into Popeyes UK.[68][69][70] In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year.[71][72] It forced a small fish and chip shop called Popeye's Takeaways in Feilding, New Zealand to change its name although the shop does not sell fried chicken.[73][74]

LOUISIANA LEGENDS®
OUR HERITAGE
Founded in 1972, the Popeyes® brand has more than 50 years of history and culinary tradition. Popeyes® owes its beginnings to entrepreneur and culinary innovator, Al Copeland. With one small restaurant and a big idea, Copeland introduced the New Orleans–style fried chicken that has now made the brand famous throughout the world. Our culinary heritage is built upon the rich Cajun and creole flavor profiles that are unmistakably Louisiana. We continuously draw upon and celebrate this heritage to inspire new, authentic menu creations the world craves. Popeyes distinguishes itself with a unique New Orleans style menu featuring spicy chicken, chicken tenders, fried shrimp and other regional items. This unique and flavorful food has allowed Popeyes to become one of the world’s largest chicken quick service restaurants, with over 2,700 restaurants in the U.S. and around the world. Our history combined with  great food, service and quality makes Popeyes restaurants genuine Louisiana Legends.

The History of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen
Popeyes didn’t grow into the number one chicken chain in the U.S. overnight; fans of our famous Louisiana-style chicken grew to Love That Chicken from Popeyes in the years following the launch of our brand in 1972.
Y’all, Popeyes has been feeding hungry guests our famous Louisiana-style chicken for a while now, and it’s been a long journey since the first Popeyes in New Orleans introduced locals with a mouth-watering menu of authentic Cajun and Creole-influenced southern cooking.
This is the story of how Popeyes grew from a single restaurant in the south to chicken chain loved across the world.
Humble beginnings
When entrepreneur Alvin C. Copeland Sr. opened the first Popeyes in the New Orleans suburb of Arabi back in 1972, he did it under a different name: Chicken on the Run. With a menu of traditional Southern-fried chicken, the restaurant struggled initially to attract customers or make its mark.
Copeland, however, was not deterred. Inspired by Cajun-cooking and his ambition to create fried chicken guests would love, he went back to the drawing board, creating a chicken recipe that gave guests a little kick of spice.
He reopened his restaurant as “Popeyes” — named for Gene Hackman’s hard-boiled police detective Popeye Doyle from the 1971 film The French Connection — and started serving the authentic New Orleans-style spicy chicken that is famous today.
Early Popeyes Food Spreads
Business heats up
The first Popeyes franchise restaurant opened in Louisiana in 1976 and started gaining a following for hometown inspired flavors. As business started to grow, Popeyes got fans singing about our chicken and introduced the famous “Love that Chicken” slogan and jingle in 1980, an iconic tune that is still spreading chicken-joy to this day.
But you can’t have a homegrown Louisiana meal without some sides, and Popeyes was about to serve up a classic. In 1983, Popeyes introduced buttermilk biscuits, and they quickly became almost as widely cherished as our chicken.
Popeyes goes global
Over the ensuing decades, Popeyes began to bring the famous flavors of New Orleans beyond all borders.
In 1984, Popeyes expanded to Toronto, Canada, marking our first international location. The next year, Popeyes opened its 500th restaurant, making it the No. 3 quick-service chicken chain based on units sold.
Popeyes was eventually bought by Restaurant Brands International in 2017, and our rapid growth and expansion has continued since. Popeyes has become one of the most beloved and successful quick-service restaurants in the world, with more than 3,800 restaurants globally
Popeyes continues to evolve
Even after Popeyes had earned the place as one of the world’s top quick-service restaurants, we didn’t stop evolving our menu.
Popeyes introduced a host of popular new culinary creations over the years, including the Wicked Chicken, Cane Sweeeet Iced Tea, Butterfly Shrimp Tackle Box, Rip'n Chick'n, Blackened Tenders, Chicken Waffle Tenders, Beer Can Chicken, and more.
And while our rich history has made the famous chicken we’re known for today, we are still crafting new delicious dishes our guests will love for years to come.

The Evolution of Popeyes Headquarters
Popeyes headquarters has undergone a significant transformation since the company‘s humble beginnings in 1972. Founded by Al Copeland in New Orleans, Louisiana, Popeyes quickly gained a loyal following for its delectable fried chicken and unique regional flavors. As the company expanded, so did the need for a centralized headquarters to oversee operations and drive growth.
For many years, Popeyes headquarters was located in Atlanta, Georgia, strategically positioned to manage the company‘s rapid expansion across the southeastern United States. However, a major shift occurred in 2017 when Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons, acquired Popeyes for a staggering $1.8 billion.
Following the acquisition, Popeyes headquarters was relocated to Miami, Florida, in a move designed to streamline operations and facilitate collaboration with its sister brands under the RBI umbrella. The Miami headquarters, situated at 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive, serves as the nerve center for Popeyes global operations, housing key executives, corporate staff, and various departments crucial to the company‘s success.
Leadership and Corporate Structure
At the helm of Popeyes is a talented and experienced leadership team, dedicated to upholding the company‘s values and driving innovation in the fast-food industry. While Popeyes itself does not have a standalone CEO, it falls under the leadership of Restaurant Brands International, with Jose Cil serving as the CEO of the parent company.
Within Popeyes, key executives play crucial roles in shaping the company‘s direction and strategies. Sami Siddiqui, appointed as President of Popeyes U.S. and Canada in September 2020, brings a wealth of experience from his previous roles at RBI, including serving as President of the Asia Pacific region for RBI and Chief Financial Officer for Burger King.
The leadership team at Popeyes headquarters works in close collaboration with the executive committee at RBI, which includes visionary leaders such as Duncan Fulton, Chief Corporate Officer, and Jill Granat, General Counsel. This synergistic relationship allows Popeyes to leverage the expertise and resources of its parent company while maintaining its unique identity and brand positioning.
Driving Innovation and Growth
Popeyes headquarters serves as the epicenter of innovation, where bold ideas are conceived, and game-changing strategies are developed. The company‘s success can be attributed to its relentless focus on menu innovation, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction.
One of the most significant initiatives to come out of Popeyes headquarters in recent years was the launch of the now-iconic Popeyes Chicken Sandwich in 2019. The sandwich, which features a crispy, juicy chicken fillet served on a brioche bun with pickles and a special sauce, quickly became a cultural phenomenon, sparking a viral social media frenzy and igniting the "Chicken Sandwich Wars" among fast-food chains.
The resounding success of the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich is a testament to the innovative spirit and market savvy of the teams at Popeyes headquarters. By staying attuned to consumer preferences and trends, the company has been able to consistently deliver products that resonate with its loyal customer base while attracting new fans to the brand.
In addition to menu innovation, Popeyes headquarters is also focused on enhancing the customer experience through digital transformation and technology. The company has invested heavily in its mobile app and online ordering platforms, making it easier for customers to access their favorite Popeyes menu items on the go. By leveraging data analytics and customer insights, Popeyes can personalize offerings and promotions, driving engagement and loyalty.
Corporate Culture and Community Impact
Beyond the strategic initiatives and business operations, Popeyes headquarters is also deeply committed to fostering a positive corporate culture and making a meaningful impact in the communities it serves. The company‘s values of authenticity, service, and quality are deeply ingrained in its DNA, guiding decision-making at all levels of the organization.
Popeyes headquarters places a strong emphasis on employee development and well-being, offering comprehensive training programs, competitive benefits, and opportunities for career growth. The company recognizes that its success is directly tied to the dedication and talent of its workforce, and it invests heavily in creating a supportive and inclusive work environment.
Moreover, Popeyes is dedicated to giving back to the communities in which it operates. Through partnerships with local organizations and philanthropic initiatives, the company aims to make a positive difference in the lives of those it serves. From supporting education programs to providing meals to those in need, Popeyes headquarters is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and a force for good.
Looking to the Future
As Popeyes continues to grow and evolve, its headquarters in Miami will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the company‘s future. With a focus on innovation, customer-centricity, and operational excellence, Popeyes is well-positioned to navigate the challenges of the fast-food industry and capitalize on new opportunities.
The company‘s strong leadership team, collaborative corporate culture, and commitment to making a positive impact set it apart from competitors and position it for long-term success. As consumer preferences shift and technology advances, Popeyes headquarters will be at the forefront of adapting and innovating to meet the changing needs of its customers.
In conclusion, Popeyes headquarters is much more than just a corporate office; it is the heart and soul of a fast-food empire that has captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world. By unraveling the inner workings of this culinary nerve center, we gain a deeper appreciation for the vision, strategies, and values that have propelled Popeyes to its current level of success and will continue to drive its growth in the years to come.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.,[6] also known as Popeyes and formerly named Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits[7] and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits,[8] is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants formed in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. As of 2021, Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants,[2] which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide.[citation needed] About 50 locations are company-owned; the other ~98% are franchised.[9]
History
Popeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as "Chicken on the Run".[6][10] Owner Al Copeland (1944–2008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken,[11] but his restaurant failed after several months.[6][11] Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken.[11] By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken.[11] Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985.[6] B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.[citation needed]
By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's.[14] AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479, and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol AFCE.[15] On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.[citation needed]
On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.[16]
On January 21, 2014, AFC was renamed as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and its NASDAQ ticker symbol was changed to PLKI.
On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.[17]
Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion.[18] On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[19]
Name
Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film The French Connection,[20][21] which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor.[22]
However, the company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye & Pals children's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.[citation needed]
The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years.[22] In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.[23]
The name is spelled "Popeyes", without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Hardee's. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was "too poor" to afford an apostrophe.[20]
Products
Popeyes mild chicken
Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni & cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entrées such as shrimp and catfish.[24] On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end.[25] On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets.[26] For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered "Sweet and Crunchy" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading.[27] In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.[28]
Chicken sandwich
Popeyes Chicken Sandwich (Spicy)
Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes.[29][30] The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.[29]
The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's.[31][32] Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich.[33] The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch.[34] Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines,[35] and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich.[36] Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.[37] On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country.[38] One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be "hustled out of money", making Popeyes guilty of "false advertising" along with "deceptive business practices".[39] On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.[40] Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.[41] A single sandwich contains 700 calories (2,900 J), 42 grams (1.5 oz) of fat, 14 grams (0.49 oz) of saturated fat, 1,443 milligrams (22.27 gr) of sodium, and 28 net grams of protein.[citation needed]
In September 2020, Popeyes' chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.[42]
Style and marketing

The restaurants' exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark "Love That Chicken" jingle[43] sung by New Orleans funk and R&B musician Dr. John.
In 2009, Popeyes introduced "Annie the Chicken Queen", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry.[44] The character is meant to be "honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. "Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what Annie is all about", Lynch said.[45]
Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races,[46][47] while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season.[48] In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway,[49] and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year's Truck Series season finale at Homestead–Miami Speedway.[50]
Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably "Love that chicken from Popeyes".[51][52]
International franchises

Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.
Popeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor;[53][54][55] it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019.[56][57] Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020,[58] and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico[59] and the United Kingdom,[60] with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021.[61] Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.[62][63] The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.
In December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.[64][65] In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022.[66] In January 2022, Popeyes Signed an agreement with South Korean Tuna Supplier Shilla International to open again in South Korea, the first one opened in January 2023.
Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.[67]
In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested £50 million into Popeyes UK.[68][69][70] In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year.[71][72] It forced a small fish and chip shop called Popeye's Takeaways in Feilding, New Zealand to change its name although the shop does not sell fried chicken.[73][74]

Gregory Miller
My first official day as CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen was November 1, 2007, but the company was holding a big franchisee meeting in Orlando a few days earlier. I wasn’t technically an employee yet, but I decided to attend and make a presentation. My hope was to inspire the entrepreneurs who own and operate Popeyes restaurants about the bright future of the brand. In retrospect, I was naive and overly optimistic.
The company had gone through four CEOs in seven years, and sales had been choppy throughout that period. The meeting made it crystal clear that the relationship between Popeyes and its franchisees was strained. One conversation in particular stands out in my mind: A veteran franchisee, a 68-year-old man from Texas, said, “Miss Cheryl, don’t expect us to trust you anytime soon. We’re like abused foster children, and you’re just a new foster parent.” It was a humbling moment. I realized that until we demonstrated some value to our owners, it was unrealistic to expect their enthusiasm for the future.
Popeyes is the third food franchising company at which I’ve been a senior executive, and I’ve fallen in love with the business model. From a strategic point of view, it’s asset-light, has a reliable cash flow, and expands a brand by leveraging entrepreneurs’ capital and operating expertise. But what I really love is the opportunity to work with the passionate, talented entrepreneurs who own and operate the restaurants. They’re buying into the brand in a way that traditional employees don’t. They’ve made a huge investment of money and time. Being a franchisee isn’t a job you can quit—it’s your life.
At the same time, this business model often results in conflict between franchisees and the parent company, particularly if they aren’t aligned on how to grow the business. To try to turn Popeyes around, my team and I decided to focus intently on the franchisees rather than other stakeholders. We decided to measure our success by their success. Nine years later, our results have improved dramatically—and while our relationship with them isn’t perfect, it is remarkably better than at that 2007 meeting in Orlando.
From P&G to KFC
After graduating from Indiana University’s MBA program in 1978, I started out in brand management at Procter & Gamble, moved to Gillette, and then joined Nabisco, where I managed snack and candy brands for seven years. My restaurant experience began in 1995, when Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino’s Pizza, hired me to run marketing and product development. I had no idea that Domino’s was having problems with its franchisees, who filed a lawsuit against the company during my first week on the job. The owners claimed that Domino’s was unfairly profiting from the dough and other supplies it sold to its franchisees. To settle the lawsuit, the management team created an audited, transparent system for the supply business and agreed to share any profits above a certain threshold with franchisees. Meanwhile, I set out to create an advisory group of owners who weren’t involved in the lawsuit to find new ways to gain franchisee alignment and drive the growth of Domino’s business. One of our biggest accomplishments was the launch of an innovation to keep pizzas hot during delivery: heated plates inside insulated bags, named Domino’s HeatWave bags.
Shortly after Domino’s was sold to Bain Capital, I was recruited to become president and chief concept officer at KFC, a division of Yum! Brands. KFC had been struggling, and its franchisees, too, were unhappy. Their contracts with KFC gave them much more power than in most franchise models; my assignment was to align the owners on a plan to grow the chicken business.
In my 30 months at KFC, we had 16 months of positive sales and 14 months of negative ones. We couldn’t turn the corner fast enough to please the CEO, the board, or the shareholders, so I was fired in the fall of 2003. The most important lesson I took away from that experience is that you cannot serve the people or the enterprise well without delivering strong results.
When I left KFC, I decided to take a break. My children were then teenagers, and my husband was a management consultant who traveled frequently. After years of being a leader at the office, I decided our family needed my leadership skills at home. During that time I did some consulting and joined boards, including the hardware chain True Value’s. Then, in 2006, I joined the board of Popeyes. I knew the company well, because I’d competed against it when I was at KFC. I had no idea I would someday become its CEO, but serving as a director turned out to be the perfect way to get a sense of the company’s challenges and opportunities.
“Servant Leadership”
Popeyes was founded in 1972 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by Al Copeland, who was what we would now call a foodie. People tell stories about Al’s passion for the recipes—how he’d stay up all night to perfect his mashed potatoes. Popeyes is called a fast-food restaurant, but it’s known for slow-cooked foods and complex flavors. We use fresh bone-in chicken and marinate it for 12 hours before cooking. We’ve built a competitive advantage around the food. The company went public in 2001, and today we’re in 48 states and 26 countries. We have 71 company-owned stores, but most of our 2,569 locations are owned by our 360 franchisees. The company receives a percentage of franchise sales, and it profits from development fees when new restaurants open.
In 2007 Popeyes was struggling for several reasons, including a lack of strategy and too much short-term thinking. Very little consideration had been given to new-product innovation. We had no arsenal of brand-building ideas. We also had no national advertising, so consumer awareness was low. Those problems, along with poor financial results, created an angry and frustrated group of franchisees. At one point some of them showed up uninvited to a Popeyes board meeting to demand changes. After the CEO resigned, I was asked to serve on the board search committee to hire a replacement. We offered the job to two candidates, but both turned it down. When the board asked me to step in as CEO, I knew it would be a difficult assignment. I also knew that it was in my sweet spot: a turnaround of a franchise-based enterprise.
After the contentious Orlando meeting, the leadership team convened in Atlanta to create a business plan. We also took a day to explore what kind of leaders we wanted to be. We made lists of our best bosses and worst bosses and described what made them good or bad. (The “worst” list was much longer.) The conversation led us to a model called servant leadership, in which leaders put the people of the enterprise above self-interest.
No one has more skin in the game than our franchisees.
Then we talked about the company’s various stakeholders: guests, shareholders, franchisees, employees, directors, suppliers. The main question was, Which group would be our top priority? The CFO argued for shareholders, and he had a point—the stock had dropped from $34 to $14. We also discussed our guests. Many of us had worked for franchised food companies that prioritize guests first, and we’d seen how that can go wrong. Some chains try to legislate their way to better customer service by creating rules that must be followed. (For instance, the restrooms must be cleaned every 30 minutes.) But a number of intermediaries separate a chain’s corporate headquarters from the customer in line at a quick-serve restaurant—the franchisee, the general manager, the shift supervisor, the restaurant team member. Unless all of them work together, the effort will certainly break down. At one point in my career, I was touring restaurants to talk to team members about the importance of serving guests well. I met a young man who was not excited about my “lesson.” He asked who I was. “I’m Cheryl,” I said. “Well, Cheryl,” he said, “there’s no place for me to hang up my coat in this restaurant, and until you think I’m important enough to have a hook where I can hang up my coat, I can’t get excited about your new guest-experience program.” It was a crucial reminder that we are in service to others—they are not in service to us.
The more my team and I talked about it, the more we saw the franchisees as our primary customers. They have mortgaged their homes or taken out large loans to open restaurants. They have signed 20-year agreements. No one has more skin in the game—they have no plan B. If we use our influence on the franchisee, he can bring his influence to bear on the restaurant manager and the frontline team members. To get a benchmark, we conducted our first franchisee satisfaction survey. We also began focusing on the metric that matters most to owners, which is restaurant-level profitability. Franchisees depend on those profits for their income and for the cash flow to open new locations. We hadn’t even been measuring that number, but we began tracking it closely.
A Big Ask
Early on, we called a meeting of our vice presidents and directors and discussed a range of issues facing Popeyes, such as the speed of our drive-through windows (which was poor). We did that classic exercise in which everyone puts a Post-it note on the problem he or she thinks should be solved first. The most revealing moment came when someone named Sondra, who’d worked at Popeyes for more than 20 years, said, “We put these problems on the wall every year, but nothing ever changes.” I was initially shocked, but I appreciated her candor. It was a reminder of the energy wasted in corporate America while people focus on work that isn’t producing results. Even CEOs shy away from hard things—they worry about getting the board aligned, or finding the money to pay for a project. I told Sondra that we wanted to be the group that finally fixed problems—not all of them, but the few on which we could focus to make the most impact. We ended up listing seven priorities on our strategic road map, and in the end we accomplished only three of them—but we did them brilliantly.
The pivotal moment in the turnaround came when we tried to sell our business plan to the franchisees. We met 10 franchise leaders in a windowless hotel conference room in Chicago. At that time, all Popeyes advertising was controlled locally, and each franchisee contributed 3% of sales to pay for ads. Our plan called for increasing that number to 4% and creating a national ad campaign, to coordinate the brand message and drive awareness. We brought in an outside expert who described the chain as being at an inflection point: The time was right to make the move from local to national advertising. The franchisees asked us to sit in the hallway while they debated the idea. When we came back in, they said they’d agree—if the company would invest $6 million to increase the number of weeks of advertising. That was a big ask. It would require board approval and would lower our earnings, disappointing Wall Street. But it was essential to gaining systemwide franchise alignment. We committed the dollars and saw it through, even when the economy went into recession in the fall of 2008. National advertising was the first critical step in driving the Popeyes turnaround.
In franchising you’re only as good as yesterday’s results.
We made some missteps along the way. We introduced some value-oriented items, including a mini chicken tortilla wrap, and people traded down to the cheaper choices, lowering the average check. But we kept at it, we found some winning new products, and sales and profitability began to improve. We developed a cadence for new-product launches. We began using sophisticated software to help franchisees choose the best locations for new restaurants, dramatically increasing their success rates. Our market share grew from the teens to the mid-20s. We attracted franchisees who owned other fast-food restaurants and wanted to open a Popeyes. A third of our stores have been built in the past five years. We’re opening more than 200 global locations a year, which puts us in the top tier of quick-service restaurants. We’ve had eight years of success—an unusual streak of steady growth in our industry.
An Act of Stewardship
Although our numbers got better, the franchisees’ trust in us didn’t improve as much as I had hoped. Franchisees have elephants’ memories. As the turnaround took hold, we had some meetings with owners that required outside facilitators to keep everyone calm; the two sides would be in opposite corners, as if in a boxing ring, with arms folded across their chests. In franchising you’re only as good as yesterday’s results—there is no emotional bank account into which you can make deposits. It feels unfair sometimes, but it’s our job to keep modeling and earning trust.
Despite that complicated dynamic, I believe deeply in the franchise model. Starting a business from scratch is very risky, and franchising allows people to invest in a proven brand, reducing that risk. It lets them pursue the American dream: 40% of Popeyes franchisees in the U.S. are first-generation immigrants. Franchising is at the heart of a thriving economy, because it lowers risk for start-ups and creates a large number of entry-level and management jobs. One-quarter of Americans say their first job was in a restaurant—often a fast-food franchise.
The Popeyes turnaround has become a case study in what happens when leaders think about serving others—in this case, our franchisees. Leadership is an act of stewardship, not a practice that’s solely for your personal benefit. The test of our leadership is simple: Are the people entrusted to our care better off? That lesson is not discussed much in business schools, and it’s not the model that many leaders of my generation have demonstrated. In fact, a lot of Baby Boomers are too concerned about their own résumés, their wealth, and their next job. Instead, we need to be teaching young leaders how to serve—as a path to generating superior results. I’m excited about that opportunity. Today young leaders are more purposeful and intentional than my generation, and they’re hungry for a new model of leadership that will make a positive difference in the world.

Good evening, 
On Tuesday August 16th at 12:33pm I placed an online order on the Popeyes app just as I have done several times in the past. My order was extremely simple just fries, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes. I arrived at the restaurant (1324 Dunn ave Jacksonville Fl 32218) around 12:45pm to pick up my order.  I drive to the drive through speaker and let the worker know I am picking up an online order, she tells me to pull around. When I get to the pickup window she tells me to pull up to the pole. I simply ask how long will it be because I am on my lunch break. The “manager” in the blue shirt (everyone else’s shirt was orange) immediately has an attitude with me and says, “I don’t know, we have to prepare it”. I then pull up to the window and wait for about 20 minutes until an older man finally comes to my car window and says they don’t have my order. I pull up the receipt on the app and show him. He says you need to talk to the manager so I pull back to the pickup window and attempt to show the manager my receipt but she refused to look at it telling me there is nothing she can do and that I need to leave. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and would not even try to listen to me or honor my receipt. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I’ve never experienced such poor service in my life. At this point I leave the restaurant in tears and in complete utter disbelief of what just happened. I’m thinking how is this fair for her to treat people like this when I am simply just trying to order lunch. I intend to take legal action. No one deserves to be treated this way. I’d love for someone from the corporate office to call me to further discuss this matter.

You really need to look at the reviews to your stores and make much needed changes. your store in KISSIMMEE FLORIDA 34743 is ATROCIOUS and the reviews speak for themselves. Popeyes is going right down the loo with the rest of the crappy chains left! GROSS! DO BETTER!!!

Your store in Southfield Michigan is horrible. Every time I go there my order is wrong. I asked if I could pay for 6 additional spicy wings and was told that they didn’t have any more wings, but the car behind me ordered 24 wings and got them. The restaurant in Southfield Michigan should be closed down because the management and their team is not professional and very disrespectful.

I ordered from one of the restaurants in Michigàn through door dash because I’m disabled and couldn’t get out on Saturday Feb 25, 2023 needless to say half my order was not in the bag. I called the restaurant and the person told me I need to take it up with door dash. I’m sorry but door dash didn’t put the order togerher. Where is my food or my money.

Palatka,Florida franchise 32177 The people that work and manage the place are rude and miss treat the customers. They keep sharing old, hard, dried out chicken that’s greasy that spent most the day under the light and when we called back and ask why we were sold old chicken they said if you don,t like it go over to publix supermarket they’re next-door. So that’s exactly what I will do for now on. I don’t have to be treated this way, and in the past year you have doubled the cost of your chicken. I got worst service than ever but the most important thing is have been treated, so you can delete this if you want I will continue bashing Popeyes chicken on social media with the rest that has had the same treatment from this franchise. It’s not just me I have a nice day.

I went to your store at 1324 Dunn Ave in Jacksonville, FL on 3/26/23 @ 7:05 p.m. I asked for a spicy chicken sandwich combo. I was told that they had none. I asked for a 3 piece mild, white meat and was told they only had breast mild and spicy dark meat. When I get to the window I hear the guy working the front counter yell out for a spicy chicken sandwich. I said I thought there was no spicy chicken sandwich. The young lady at the window says “We don’t”..I say he just called out for one.. she replies “I mean it’s going to be a wait”..I tell her you didn’t say it was a wait you said there was none… she says “Well do you wanna wait”…I told her I’ve already paid for my food.. she said “ok” and turned and closed the window. Why was I not given the option to wait which I would have because that was what my son wanted. There is always something at this place.

Have serious issues in Palm Bay Road location. I was in the drive thru with no other cars in front of me. Person asked me to hold on so I did. Comes back after a long wait to say they aren’t talking orders at the drive through at this time. So I parked and went in. A few people were waiting for their food. Took quite a while before being greeted. While waiting : almost all chairs in the dining room were on top of the tables as if they were closed, the person from drive through was vaping! Not sure she realized anyone saw that. Another person in back leaning over the counter texting on their phone. Everything came across very disorganized- with 6 or more workers visible.
Placed the order and .. wait. Finally when the next person orders spicy chicken, they tell them it’s a wait and that I’m waiting as well- ok someone could have told me that or asked if I’d wait but- awesome- fresh chicken is worth the wait. However, I would have ordered the family meal but was told they only had fries. When another person asked about sides they explained that they had them but no lids ( wondering why they didn’t wrap in plastic or foil). . Smh 🤦‍♀️ . Phone texter has moved and is now in a chair still visible to all up front ( on break? 🤷‍♀️ )Btw-the remaining cars in the drive through seemed to be helped- apparently they were still taking drive through orders.. just not mine.
All of this was happening between 4:45-5:15 pm.
Since Covid I’m so much more patient and understanding. This was pretty bad. Stopped elsewhere for side dishes. Up side is at least the chicken and biscuits were good.

Today at 500pm I went through the drive thru to order some food. The store manager which noticed me and my daughter became very rude, over some personal issues he had. He told his cash not to ring us up and took my debit card. He then canceled my order and told us to get out of his line. We did not get our food.

Glad to see others complaining about this business establishment!!! Their management sucks. Most of the time you don’t get the correct or full order. The better business bureau should look at putting Popeyes out of business!!!

Employees pay went up and service went down. I stop at popeyes four times a week. At on an average of $12.42 a day per week is $ 49.68 x 52 weeks is $2583.36 a year x 17 years is $43917.12 . I show this because your store on 9 mile rd in Pensacola Fl cant do math or get on order right . Now make no mistake I LOVE YOUR CHICKEN . But I will no longer be spending any more of my money with your company. I have tryed several time to get this resolved with no result. I’m only one customer but if this keeps up and more people leave then that’s means your bottom line is going to drop even more and at that point doors will close.

I am a door dasher and every Popeyes in New Orleans East needs new management and their crews replaced their very unprofessional my door dash orders comes to my phone ten minutes before I get to store once I get to the stores each restaurant has the door dash receipts stacked up in piles infront of and onside of register so when we come to pick up order they have to go through a pile of receipts just to begin a door dash order that was ordered ten minutes before we even reach the restaurant also they all have nasty attitudes as if it’s our fault they have multiple orders again someone needs to retrain or remove Popeyes employees from all New Orleans east stores and gentilly I would not order food from Popeyes through door dash or mobile because they don’t care about those customers..

April 21, 2024by Tom Wells
Popeyes, the beloved fast-food chain renowned for its Louisiana-style fried chicken and signature sides, has captured the hearts and taste buds of millions worldwide. With over 3,451 locations spanning 46 states in the U.S. and 30 countries globally, Popeyes has become a true fast-food powerhouse. But have you ever wondered about the nerve center that keeps this culinary empire running smoothly? In this comprehensive blog post, we‘ll take a deep dive into Popeyes headquarters, exploring its history, leadership, corporate culture, and the strategies that have propelled the company to success.

The Evolution of Popeyes Headquarters
Popeyes headquarters has undergone a significant transformation since the company‘s humble beginnings in 1972. Founded by Al Copeland in New Orleans, Louisiana, Popeyes quickly gained a loyal following for its delectable fried chicken and unique regional flavors. As the company expanded, so did the need for a centralized headquarters to oversee operations and drive growth.
For many years, Popeyes headquarters was located in Atlanta, Georgia, strategically positioned to manage the company‘s rapid expansion across the southeastern United States. However, a major shift occurred in 2017 when Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons, acquired Popeyes for a staggering $1.8 billion.
Following the acquisition, Popeyes headquarters was relocated to Miami, Florida, in a move designed to streamline operations and facilitate collaboration with its sister brands under the RBI umbrella. The Miami headquarters, situated at 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive, serves as the nerve center for Popeyes global operations, housing key executives, corporate staff, and various departments crucial to the company‘s success.
Leadership and Corporate Structure
At the helm of Popeyes is a talented and experienced leadership team, dedicated to upholding the company‘s values and driving innovation in the fast-food industry. While Popeyes itself does not have a standalone CEO, it falls under the leadership of Restaurant Brands International, with Jose Cil serving as the CEO of the parent company.
Within Popeyes, key executives play crucial roles in shaping the company‘s direction and strategies. Sami Siddiqui, appointed as President of Popeyes U.S. and Canada in September 2020, brings a wealth of experience from his previous roles at RBI, including serving as President of the Asia Pacific region for RBI and Chief Financial Officer for Burger King.
The leadership team at Popeyes headquarters works in close collaboration with the executive committee at RBI, which includes visionary leaders such as Duncan Fulton, Chief Corporate Officer, and Jill Granat, General Counsel. This synergistic relationship allows Popeyes to leverage the expertise and resources of its parent company while maintaining its unique identity and brand positioning.
Driving Innovation and Growth
Popeyes headquarters serves as the epicenter of innovation, where bold ideas are conceived, and game-changing strategies are developed. The company‘s success can be attributed to its relentless focus on menu innovation, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction.
One of the most significant initiatives to come out of Popeyes headquarters in recent years was the launch of the now-iconic Popeyes Chicken Sandwich in 2019. The sandwich, which features a crispy, juicy chicken fillet served on a brioche bun with pickles and a special sauce, quickly became a cultural phenomenon, sparking a viral social media frenzy and igniting the "Chicken Sandwich Wars" among fast-food chains.
The resounding success of the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich is a testament to the innovative spirit and market savvy of the teams at Popeyes headquarters. By staying attuned to consumer preferences and trends, the company has been able to consistently deliver products that resonate with its loyal customer base while attracting new fans to the brand.
In addition to menu innovation, Popeyes headquarters is also focused on enhancing the customer experience through digital transformation and technology. The company has invested heavily in its mobile app and online ordering platforms, making it easier for customers to access their favorite Popeyes menu items on the go. By leveraging data analytics and customer insights, Popeyes can personalize offerings and promotions, driving engagement and loyalty.
Corporate Culture and Community Impact
Beyond the strategic initiatives and business operations, Popeyes headquarters is also deeply committed to fostering a positive corporate culture and making a meaningful impact in the communities it serves. The company‘s values of authenticity, service, and quality are deeply ingrained in its DNA, guiding decision-making at all levels of the organization.
Popeyes headquarters places a strong emphasis on employee development and well-being, offering comprehensive training programs, competitive benefits, and opportunities for career growth. The company recognizes that its success is directly tied to the dedication and talent of its workforce, and it invests heavily in creating a supportive and inclusive work environment.
Moreover, Popeyes is dedicated to giving back to the communities in which it operates. Through partnerships with local organizations and philanthropic initiatives, the company aims to make a positive difference in the lives of those it serves. From supporting education programs to providing meals to those in need, Popeyes headquarters is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and a force for good.
Looking to the Future
As Popeyes continues to grow and evolve, its headquarters in Miami will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the company‘s future. With a focus on innovation, customer-centricity, and operational excellence, Popeyes is well-positioned to navigate the challenges of the fast-food industry and capitalize on new opportunities.
The company‘s strong leadership team, collaborative corporate culture, and commitment to making a positive impact set it apart from competitors and position it for long-term success. As consumer preferences shift and technology advances, Popeyes headquarters will be at the forefront of adapting and innovating to meet the changing needs of its customers.
In conclusion, Popeyes headquarters is much more than just a corporate office; it is the heart and soul of a fast-food empire that has captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world. By unraveling the inner workings of this culinary nerve center, we gain a deeper appreciation for the vision, strategies, and values that have propelled Popeyes to its current level of success and will continue to drive its growth in the years to come.

This will serve him well as we accelerate net restaurant growth internationally in the coming years.

Mr. Siddiqui has been at RBI for eleven years, including eight years as brand President for Popeyes in Miami, all of our brands in the Asia Pacific region and Tim Hortons in Toronto.

He has been a great partner and will be a valued strategic advisor to Thiago.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.,[6] also known as Popeyes and formerly named Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits[7] and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits,[8] is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants formed in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. As of 2021, Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants,[2] which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide.[citation needed] About 50 locations are company-owned; the other ~98% are franchised.[9]
History
Popeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as "Chicken on the Run".[6][10] Owner Al Copeland (1944–2008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken,[11] but his restaurant failed after several months.[6][11] Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken.[11] By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken.[11] Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985.[6] B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.[citation needed]
By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's.[14] AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479, and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol AFCE.[15] On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.[citation needed]
On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.[16]
On January 21, 2014, AFC was renamed as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and its NASDAQ ticker symbol was changed to PLKI.
On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.[17]
Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion.[18] On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[19]
Name
Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film The French Connection,[20][21] which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor.[22]
However, the company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye & Pals children's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.[citation needed]
The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years.[22] In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.[23]
The name is spelled "Popeyes", without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Hardee's. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was "too poor" to afford an apostrophe.[20]
Products
Popeyes mild chicken
Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni & cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entrées such as shrimp and catfish.[24] On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end.[25] On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets.[26] For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered "Sweet and Crunchy" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading.[27] In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.[28]
Chicken sandwich
Popeyes Chicken Sandwich (Spicy)
Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes.[29][30] The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.[29]
The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's.[31][32] Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich.[33] The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch.[34] Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines,[35] and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich.[36] Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.[37] On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country.[38] One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be "hustled out of money", making Popeyes guilty of "false advertising" along with "deceptive business practices".[39] On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.[40] Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.[41] A single sandwich contains 700 calories (2,900 J), 42 grams (1.5 oz) of fat, 14 grams (0.49 oz) of saturated fat, 1,443 milligrams (22.27 gr) of sodium, and 28 net grams of protein.[citation needed]
In September 2020, Popeyes' chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.[42]
Style and marketing

The restaurants' exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark "Love That Chicken" jingle[43] sung by New Orleans funk and R&B musician Dr. John.
In 2009, Popeyes introduced "Annie the Chicken Queen", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry.[44] The character is meant to be "honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. "Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what Annie is all about", Lynch said.[45]
Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races,[46][47] while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season.[48] In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway,[49] and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year's Truck Series season finale at Homestead–Miami Speedway.[50]
Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably "Love that chicken from Popeyes".[51][52]
International franchises

Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.
Popeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor;[53][54][55] it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019.[56][57] Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020,[58] and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico[59] and the United Kingdom,[60] with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021.[61] Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.[62][63] The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.
In December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.[64][65] In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022.[66] In January 2022, Popeyes Signed an agreement with South Korean Tuna Supplier Shilla International to open again in South Korea, the first one opened in January 2023.
Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.[67]
In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested £50 million into Popeyes UK.[68][69][70] In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year.[71][72] It forced a small fish and chip shop called Popeye's Takeaways in Feilding, New Zealand to change its name although the shop does not sell fried chicken.[73][74]

My first official day as CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen was November 1, 2007, but the company was holding a big franchisee meeting in Orlando a few days earlier. I wasn’t technically an employee yet, but I decided to attend and make a presentation. My hope was to inspire the entrepreneurs who own and operate Popeyes restaurants about the bright future of the brand. In retrospect, I was naive and overly optimistic.
The company had gone through four CEOs in seven years, and sales had been choppy throughout that period. The meeting made it crystal clear that the relationship between Popeyes and its franchisees was strained. One conversation in particular stands out in my mind: A veteran franchisee, a 68-year-old man from Texas, said, “Miss Cheryl, don’t expect us to trust you anytime soon. We’re like abused foster children, and you’re just a new foster parent.” It was a humbling moment. I realized that until we demonstrated some value to our owners, it was unrealistic to expect their enthusiasm for the future.
Popeyes is the third food franchising company at which I’ve been a senior executive, and I’ve fallen in love with the business model. From a strategic point of view, it’s asset-light, has a reliable cash flow, and expands a brand by leveraging entrepreneurs’ capital and operating expertise. But what I really love is the opportunity to work with the passionate, talented entrepreneurs who own and operate the restaurants. They’re buying into the brand in a way that traditional employees don’t. They’ve made a huge investment of money and time. Being a franchisee isn’t a job you can quit—it’s your life.
At the same time, this business model often results in conflict between franchisees and the parent company, particularly if they aren’t aligned on how to grow the business. To try to turn Popeyes around, my team and I decided to focus intently on the franchisees rather than other stakeholders. We decided to measure our success by their success. Nine years later, our results have improved dramatically—and while our relationship with them isn’t perfect, it is remarkably better than at that 2007 meeting in Orlando.
From P&G to KFC
After graduating from Indiana University’s MBA program in 1978, I started out in brand management at Procter & Gamble, moved to Gillette, and then joined Nabisco, where I managed snack and candy brands for seven years. My restaurant experience began in 1995, when Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino’s Pizza, hired me to run marketing and product development. I had no idea that Domino’s was having problems with its franchisees, who filed a lawsuit against the company during my first week on the job. The owners claimed that Domino’s was unfairly profiting from the dough and other supplies it sold to its franchisees. To settle the lawsuit, the management team created an audited, transparent system for the supply business and agreed to share any profits above a certain threshold with franchisees. Meanwhile, I set out to create an advisory group of owners who weren’t involved in the lawsuit to find new ways to gain franchisee alignment and drive the growth of Domino’s business. One of our biggest accomplishments was the launch of an innovation to keep pizzas hot during delivery: heated plates inside insulated bags, named Domino’s HeatWave bags.
Shortly after Domino’s was sold to Bain Capital, I was recruited to become president and chief concept officer at KFC, a division of Yum! Brands. KFC had been struggling, and its franchisees, too, were unhappy. Their contracts with KFC gave them much more power than in most franchise models; my assignment was to align the owners on a plan to grow the chicken business.
In my 30 months at KFC, we had 16 months of positive sales and 14 months of negative ones. We couldn’t turn the corner fast enough to please the CEO, the board, or the shareholders, so I was fired in the fall of 2003. The most important lesson I took away from that experience is that you cannot serve the people or the enterprise well without delivering strong results.
When I left KFC, I decided to take a break. My children were then teenagers, and my husband was a management consultant who traveled frequently. After years of being a leader at the office, I decided our family needed my leadership skills at home. During that time I did some consulting and joined boards, including the hardware chain True Value’s. Then, in 2006, I joined the board of Popeyes. I knew the company well, because I’d competed against it when I was at KFC. I had no idea I would someday become its CEO, but serving as a director turned out to be the perfect way to get a sense of the company’s challenges and opportunities.
“Servant Leadership”
Popeyes was founded in 1972 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by Al Copeland, who was what we would now call a foodie. People tell stories about Al’s passion for the recipes—how he’d stay up all night to perfect his mashed potatoes. Popeyes is called a fast-food restaurant, but it’s known for slow-cooked foods and complex flavors. We use fresh bone-in chicken and marinate it for 12 hours before cooking. We’ve built a competitive advantage around the food. The company went public in 2001, and today we’re in 48 states and 26 countries. We have 71 company-owned stores, but most of our 2,569 locations are owned by our 360 franchisees. The company receives a percentage of franchise sales, and it profits from development fees when new restaurants open.
In 2007 Popeyes was struggling for several reasons, including a lack of strategy and too much short-term thinking. Very little consideration had been given to new-product innovation. We had no arsenal of brand-building ideas. We also had no national advertising, so consumer awareness was low. Those problems, along with poor financial results, created an angry and frustrated group of franchisees. At one point some of them showed up uninvited to a Popeyes board meeting to demand changes. After the CEO resigned, I was asked to serve on the board search committee to hire a replacement. We offered the job to two candidates, but both turned it down. When the board asked me to step in as CEO, I knew it would be a difficult assignment. I also knew that it was in my sweet spot: a turnaround of a franchise-based enterprise.
After the contentious Orlando meeting, the leadership team convened in Atlanta to create a business plan. We also took a day to explore what kind of leaders we wanted to be. We made lists of our best bosses and worst bosses and described what made them good or bad. (The “worst” list was much longer.) The conversation led us to a model called servant leadership, in which leaders put the people of the enterprise above self-interest.
No one has more skin in the game than our franchisees.
Then we talked about the company’s various stakeholders: guests, shareholders, franchisees, employees, directors, suppliers. The main question was, Which group would be our top priority? The CFO argued for shareholders, and he had a point—the stock had dropped from $34 to $14. We also discussed our guests. Many of us had worked for franchised food companies that prioritize guests first, and we’d seen how that can go wrong. Some chains try to legislate their way to better customer service by creating rules that must be followed. (For instance, the restrooms must be cleaned every 30 minutes.) But a number of intermediaries separate a chain’s corporate headquarters from the customer in line at a quick-serve restaurant—the franchisee, the general manager, the shift supervisor, the restaurant team member. Unless all of them work together, the effort will certainly break down. At one point in my career, I was touring restaurants to talk to team members about the importance of serving guests well. I met a young man who was not excited about my “lesson.” He asked who I was. “I’m Cheryl,” I said. “Well, Cheryl,” he said, “there’s no place for me to hang up my coat in this restaurant, and until you think I’m important enough to have a hook where I can hang up my coat, I can’t get excited about your new guest-experience program.” It was a crucial reminder that we are in service to others—they are not in service to us.
The more my team and I talked about it, the more we saw the franchisees as our primary customers. They have mortgaged their homes or taken out large loans to open restaurants. They have signed 20-year agreements. No one has more skin in the game—they have no plan B. If we use our influence on the franchisee, he can bring his influence to bear on the restaurant manager and the frontline team members. To get a benchmark, we conducted our first franchisee satisfaction survey. We also began focusing on the metric that matters most to owners, which is restaurant-level profitability. Franchisees depend on those profits for their income and for the cash flow to open new locations. We hadn’t even been measuring that number, but we began tracking it closely.
A Big Ask
Early on, we called a meeting of our vice presidents and directors and discussed a range of issues facing Popeyes, such as the speed of our drive-through windows (which was poor). We did that classic exercise in which everyone puts a Post-it note on the problem he or she thinks should be solved first. The most revealing moment came when someone named Sondra, who’d worked at Popeyes for more than 20 years, said, “We put these problems on the wall every year, but nothing ever changes.” I was initially shocked, but I appreciated her candor. It was a reminder of the energy wasted in corporate America while people focus on work that isn’t producing results. Even CEOs shy away from hard things—they worry about getting the board aligned, or finding the money to pay for a project. I told Sondra that we wanted to be the group that finally fixed problems—not all of them, but the few on which we could focus to make the most impact. We ended up listing seven priorities on our strategic road map, and in the end we accomplished only three of them—but we did them brilliantly.
The pivotal moment in the turnaround came when we tried to sell our business plan to the franchisees. We met 10 franchise leaders in a windowless hotel conference room in Chicago. At that time, all Popeyes advertising was controlled locally, and each franchisee contributed 3% of sales to pay for ads. Our plan called for increasing that number to 4% and creating a national ad campaign, to coordinate the brand message and drive awareness. We brought in an outside expert who described the chain as being at an inflection point: The time was right to make the move from local to national advertising. The franchisees asked us to sit in the hallway while they debated the idea. When we came back in, they said they’d agree—if the company would invest $6 million to increase the number of weeks of advertising. That was a big ask. It would require board approval and would lower our earnings, disappointing Wall Street. But it was essential to gaining systemwide franchise alignment. We committed the dollars and saw it through, even when the economy went into recession in the fall of 2008. National advertising was the first critical step in driving the Popeyes turnaround.
In franchising you’re only as good as yesterday’s results.
We made some missteps along the way. We introduced some value-oriented items, including a mini chicken tortilla wrap, and people traded down to the cheaper choices, lowering the average check. But we kept at it, we found some winning new products, and sales and profitability began to improve. We developed a cadence for new-product launches. We began using sophisticated software to help franchisees choose the best locations for new restaurants, dramatically increasing their success rates. Our market share grew from the teens to the mid-20s. We attracted franchisees who owned other fast-food restaurants and wanted to open a Popeyes. A third of our stores have been built in the past five years. We’re opening more than 200 global locations a year, which puts us in the top tier of quick-service restaurants. We’ve had eight years of success—an unusual streak of steady growth in our industry.
An Act of Stewardship
Although our numbers got better, the franchisees’ trust in us didn’t improve as much as I had hoped. Franchisees have elephants’ memories. As the turnaround took hold, we had some meetings with owners that required outside facilitators to keep everyone calm; the two sides would be in opposite corners, as if in a boxing ring, with arms folded across their chests. In franchising you’re only as good as yesterday’s results—there is no emotional bank account into which you can make deposits. It feels unfair sometimes, but it’s our job to keep modeling and earning trust.
Despite that complicated dynamic, I believe deeply in the franchise model. Starting a business from scratch is very risky, and franchising allows people to invest in a proven brand, reducing that risk. It lets them pursue the American dream: 40% of Popeyes franchisees in the U.S. are first-generation immigrants. Franchising is at the heart of a thriving economy, because it lowers risk for start-ups and creates a large number of entry-level and management jobs. One-quarter of Americans say their first job was in a restaurant—often a fast-food franchise.
The Popeyes turnaround has become a case study in what happens when leaders think about serving others—in this case, our franchisees. Leadership is an act of stewardship, not a practice that’s solely for your personal benefit. The test of our leadership is simple: Are the people entrusted to our care better off? That lesson is not discussed much in business schools, and it’s not the model that many leaders of my generation have demonstrated. In fact, a lot of Baby Boomers are too concerned about their own résumés, their wealth, and their next job. Instead, we need to be teaching young leaders how to serve—as a path to generating superior results. I’m excited about that opportunity. Today young leaders are more purposeful and intentional than my generation, and they’re hungry for a new model of leadership that will make a positive difference in the world.

Good evening, 
On Tuesday August 16th at 12:33pm I placed an online order on the Popeyes app just as I have done several times in the past. My order was extremely simple just fries, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes. I arrived at the restaurant (1324 Dunn ave Jacksonville Fl 32218) around 12:45pm to pick up my order.  I drive to the drive through speaker and let the worker know I am picking up an online order, she tells me to pull around. When I get to the pickup window she tells me to pull up to the pole. I simply ask how long will it be because I am on my lunch break. The “manager” in the blue shirt (everyone else’s shirt was orange) immediately has an attitude with me and says, “I don’t know, we have to prepare it”. I then pull up to the window and wait for about 20 minutes until an older man finally comes to my car window and says they don’t have my order. I pull up the receipt on the app and show him. He says you need to talk to the manager so I pull back to the pickup window and attempt to show the manager my receipt but she refused to look at it telling me there is nothing she can do and that I need to leave. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and would not even try to listen to me or honor my receipt. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I’ve never experienced such poor service in my life. At this point I leave the restaurant in tears and in complete utter disbelief of what just happened. I’m thinking how is this fair for her to treat people like this when I am simply just trying to order lunch. I intend to take legal action. No one deserves to be treated this way. I’d love for someone from the corporate office to call me to further discuss this matter.

You really need to look at the reviews to your stores and make much needed changes. your store in KISSIMMEE FLORIDA 34743 is ATROCIOUS and the reviews speak for themselves. Popeyes is going right down the loo with the rest of the crappy chains left! GROSS! DO BETTER!!!

Your store in Southfield Michigan is horrible. Every time I go there my order is wrong. I asked if I could pay for 6 additional spicy wings and was told that they didn’t have any more wings, but the car behind me ordered 24 wings and got them. The restaurant in Southfield Michigan should be closed down because the management and their team is not professional and very disrespectful.

I ordered from one of the restaurants in Michigàn through door dash because I’m disabled and couldn’t get out on Saturday Feb 25, 2023 needless to say half my order was not in the bag. I called the restaurant and the person told me I need to take it up with door dash. I’m sorry but door dash didn’t put the order togerher. Where is my food or my money.

Palatka,Florida franchise 32177 The people that work and manage the place are rude and miss treat the customers. They keep sharing old, hard, dried out chicken that’s greasy that spent most the day under the light and when we called back and ask why we were sold old chicken they said if you don,t like it go over to publix supermarket they’re next-door. So that’s exactly what I will do for now on. I don’t have to be treated this way, and in the past year you have doubled the cost of your chicken. I got worst service than ever but the most important thing is have been treated, so you can delete this if you want I will continue bashing Popeyes chicken on social media with the rest that has had the same treatment from this franchise. It’s not just me I have a nice day.

I went to your store at 1324 Dunn Ave in Jacksonville, FL on 3/26/23 @ 7:05 p.m. I asked for a spicy chicken sandwich combo. I was told that they had none. I asked for a 3 piece mild, white meat and was told they only had breast mild and spicy dark meat. When I get to the window I hear the guy working the front counter yell out for a spicy chicken sandwich. I said I thought there was no spicy chicken sandwich. The young lady at the window says “We don’t”..I say he just called out for one.. she replies “I mean it’s going to be a wait”..I tell her you didn’t say it was a wait you said there was none… she says “Well do you wanna wait”…I told her I’ve already paid for my food.. she said “ok” and turned and closed the window. Why was I not given the option to wait which I would have because that was what my son wanted. There is always something at this place.

Have serious issues in Palm Bay Road location. I was in the drive thru with no other cars in front of me. Person asked me to hold on so I did. Comes back after a long wait to say they aren’t talking orders at the drive through at this time. So I parked and went in. A few people were waiting for their food. Took quite a while before being greeted. While waiting : almost all chairs in the dining room were on top of the tables as if they were closed, the person from drive through was vaping! Not sure she realized anyone saw that. Another person in back leaning over the counter texting on their phone. Everything came across very disorganized- with 6 or more workers visible.
Placed the order and .. wait. Finally when the next person orders spicy chicken, they tell them it’s a wait and that I’m waiting as well- ok someone could have told me that or asked if I’d wait but- awesome- fresh chicken is worth the wait. However, I would have ordered the family meal but was told they only had fries. When another person asked about sides they explained that they had them but no lids ( wondering why they didn’t wrap in plastic or foil). . Smh 🤦‍♀️ . Phone texter has moved and is now in a chair still visible to all up front ( on break? 🤷‍♀️ )Btw-the remaining cars in the drive through seemed to be helped- apparently they were still taking drive through orders.. just not mine.
All of this was happening between 4:45-5:15 pm.
Since Covid I’m so much more patient and understanding. This was pretty bad. Stopped elsewhere for side dishes. Up side is at least the chicken and biscuits were good.

Today at 500pm I went through the drive thru to order some food. The store manager which noticed me and my daughter became very rude, over some personal issues he had. He told his cash not to ring us up and took my debit card. He then canceled my order and told us to get out of his line. We did not get our food.

Glad to see others complaining about this business establishment!!! Their management sucks. Most of the time you don’t get the correct or full order. The better business bureau should look at putting Popeyes out of business!!!

Employees pay went up and service went down. I stop at popeyes four times a week. At on an average of $12.42 a day per week is $ 49.68 x 52 weeks is $2583.36 a year x 17 years is $43917.12 . I show this because your store on 9 mile rd in Pensacola Fl cant do math or get on order right . Now make no mistake I LOVE YOUR CHICKEN . But I will no longer be spending any more of my money with your company. I have tryed several time to get this resolved with no result. I’m only one customer but if this keeps up and more people leave then that’s means your bottom line is going to drop even more and at that point doors will close.

I am a door dasher and every Popeyes in New Orleans East needs new management and their crews replaced their very unprofessional my door dash orders comes to my phone ten minutes before I get to store once I get to the stores each restaurant has the door dash receipts stacked up in piles infront of and onside of register so when we come to pick up order they have to go through a pile of receipts just to begin a door dash order that was ordered ten minutes before we even reach the restaurant also they all have nasty attitudes as if it’s our fault they have multiple orders again someone needs to retrain or remove Popeyes employees from all New Orleans east stores and gentilly I would not order food from Popeyes through door dash or mobile because they don’t care about those customers..

Popeyes (QSR) is giving investors something to love.
The popular chicken sandwich drove same-store sales of 34% during the fourth quarter at Popeyes — crushing Wall Street expectations of 15%.
“Popeyes launched an iconic Chicken Sandwich that has proven to be a game-changer for the brand in every way,” Popeyes parent company Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil said in a statement.
Popeyes jaw-dropping fourth quarter comes on the heels of a pretty impressive third quarter when the chicken chain reported same-store sales growth of 9.7%.
After two years of innovation, Popeyes launched its first-ever chicken sandwich Aug. 12, 2019. With four seemingly simple ingredients — a buttered brioche bun, cajun-inspired mayonnaise, a crispy fried chicken filet and naturally-brined pickles — Popeyes had no idea it was about to change the fast food chicken sandwich game in America.
“This is a big moment for our brand. This has been the biggest launch in the history of Popeyes, if not QSR,” Popeyes America’s President Felipe Athayde told Yahoo Finance in an interview at the time. “It’s going to be a cultural phenomenon. We just launched the iPhone of chicken sandwiches.”

The chicken sandwich craze
After a Twitter feud between rivals Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s (WEN), the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich went viral and sold out in stores in just two short weeks.
The chicken chain was expecting the supply to last for at least three months, but the unintended viral social media attention drove huge levels of traffic to stores and wiped out chicken supplies within weeks. It took Popeyes about three months to bring back the chicken sandwich on Nov. 3, 2019.
Here were the main numbers for Restaurant Brands’ fourth quarter, compared to Bloomberg estimates:
Revenue: $1.48 billion vs. $1.47 billion expected
Adjusted earnings per share: 75 cents vs. 73 cents expected
Burger King same-store sales: +2.8% vs. +3.4% expected
Popeyes same-store sales: +34.4% vs. +15% expected
Tim Hortons same-store sales: -4.3% vs. -2.6% expected
"Burger King delivered its strongest year of restaurant growth in the last two decades,” Cil said. “At Tim Hortons, our performance did not reflect the incredible power of our brand and it is clear that we have a large opportunity to refocus on our founding values and what has made us famous with our guests over the years, which will be the basis for our plan in 2020.”
Shares of Restaurant Brands were 3.35% higher in pre-market trading, as of 7:44 a.m. ET. The earnings conference call with management kicks off at 8:30 a.m. ET.

POULTRY FUTURE
Popeyes parent company names Joshua Kobza new CEO
Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Burger King and more, appointed Joshua Kobza as CEO, effective March 1, 2023.
Elizabeth Doughman
February 15, 2023
HUDSON, WI/USA - JUNE 7, 2019: Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen exterior. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is an American chain of fried chicken fast food restaurants.Wolterk | Bigstock.com
Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Burger King and more, appointed Joshua Kobza as CEO, effective March 1, 2023.
Kobza will replace Jose Cil, who will stay on with RBI for one year as an adviser to assist in the transition.
Over the past 11 years, Kobza has held several senior positions at RBI including chief financial officer (2013-2018), chief technology officer and development officer (2018-2019) and chief operating officer (2019-2023). 
Kobza played an integral role in RBI’s acquisition of Tim Hortons in 2014, Popeyes in 2017 and Firehouse Subs in 2021. Popeyes saw sales soar in 2019, jumpstarting the chicken sandwich wars among foodservice competitors. More recently, Burger King launched three new chicken sandwiches: the Mexican Original Chicken Sandwich, Italian Original Chicken Sandwich and American Original Chicken Sandwich.
He will report to RBI executive chairman, Patrick Doyle.
Doyle stated: "Over the past several years, the Board of Directors has worked with management to build a thoughtful succession plan for key positions, so this is a natural transition for Josh to lead our next phase of growth. Personally, I'm motivated to work with and help such a talented person like Josh as he steps into this new leadership position.”
"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank José for his unwavering dedication and passion for growing our restaurant brands and for the progress we have made, most recently evidenced by our latest quarterly results. José has been an exceptional partner and friend and he has all of our thanks and support as he becomes a valued strategic advisor to the company.”
Kobza added: “"I am excited to lead the company and work closely with our business presidents to put our franchisees at the center of our success and accelerate the growth we know our brands are capable of.”

Restaurant Brands International Announces Leadership Changes to Support Long-Term Growth
Sami Siddiqui has been appointed Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Matt Dunnigan who is leaving the company. Jeff Klein has been appointed as President of Popeyes US and Canada, succeeding Mr. Siddiqui who has led the brand for nearly four years. Thiago Santelmo has been appointed President of International. Mr. Santelmo succeeds David Shear, who will remain with the Company for a year as an advisor and assist in the transition. Today's leadership changes are effective immediately and a new President of EMEA and Chief Marketing Officer ("CMO") for Popeyes will be named at a later date.  
"Sami, Thiago and Jeff are proven, valuable leaders in the company and I'm looking forward to working with them as we deliver on our next phase of growth," said Mr. Kobza. "Sami has deep finance and operational experience which makes him a great partner to our Presidents as we deliver on our growth plans across the company. Thiago has spent his career building master franchisee relationships and working closely with them to develop new markets. This will serve him well as we accelerate net restaurant growth internationally in the coming years. Jeff has two decades of marketing and consumer insight experience with large, well-known brands, and will bring this guest-centered approach to making Popeyes 'Easy to Love' across the US and Canada," continued Mr. Kobza.
Mr. Siddiqui has been at RBI for eleven years, including eight years as brand President for Popeyes in Miami, all of our brands in the Asia Pacific region and Tim Hortons in Toronto. Under his leadership, Popeyes has achieved record levels of sales, restaurant growth, and profitability, recently solidifying the brand as the #2 chicken player in the US. Mr. Siddiqui initially joined the Company as head of finance and investor relations before becoming Brand CFO for Tim Hortons and later Burger King. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Siddiqui worked at Blackstone and has an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Santelmo joined the Company eleven years ago, focusing on growth in Latin America as General Manager and then subsequently President for the region. Mr. Santelmo has also been a leader of the Company's growth in the EMEA region, focusing on new country entries, developing new master franchisee partnerships and has served as President of the region for the last two years. Mr. Santelmo has an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Klein joined the Popeyes leadership team two years ago as Chief Marketing Officer and brings 25 years experience in marketing and consumer insights. Mr. Klein previously was CMO for Little Caesars Pizza and spent 15 years at PepsiCo in senior marketing positions, including Senior Vice President and CMO for PepsiCo Foodservice. Mr. Klein is known for driving product innovation and integrating brand marketing campaigns with strong operational execution.  
"I want to thank David and Matt for their years of service in building our Company and growing our restaurant brands. David established a strong network of global franchisees and dedicated franchise support infrastructure which has contributed to the exciting growth of our international business over the past decade. He has been a great partner and will be a valued strategic advisor to Thiago. Matt secured a strong capital structure and developed a balanced capital allocation framework that now supports the investments you have been seeing us make in our brands. As a result of David and Matt's leadership over the years, we are very well set up for our next period of growth," concluded Mr. Kobza.

Restaurant Brands, parent of Popeyes, Burger King delivers strong Q4 earnings, names new CEO

QSR
-0.44%
Restaurant Brands International (QSR) reported Q4 2022 earnings on Tuesday, February 14 before the market open that mostly were in line with expectations.
This quarter, which ended December 31, 2022, same-store sales drove strong results, up 9.40%, in addition to restaurant growth, up 4%. The company also appointed Joshua Kobza (the current COO) as the company's new CEO effective March 1, 2023, as it eyes the future growth plans for its brands which include Tim Hortons, Popeyes, Burger King, and Firehouse Subs. Shares were down in the pre-market following the news.
In a separate release posted to its site, newly appointed Executive Chairman Patrick Doyle said the succession has been in the works for the past several years.
"Over the past several years, the Board of Directors has worked with management to build a thoughtful succession plan for key positions, so this is a natural transition for Josh to lead our next phase of growth," Doyle said. Acknowledging current CEO Cil, he added: "José has been an exceptional partner and friend and he has all of our thanks and support as he becomes a valued strategic advisor to the company."
Here are the restaurant giant's results compared to Wall Street estimates:
Revenue: $1.69 billion versus $1.68 billion expected
Adjusted earnings per share: $0.72 versus 0.74 expected
Same-store sales: up 7.90% versus 7.92%
Tim Hortons same-store sales: up 9.4%% versus 7.19% expected
Burger King same-store sales: up 8.40% versus 8.91% expected
Popeyes same-store sales: up 3.80% versus 3.14% expected
Firehouse Subs same-store sales: up 0.4% versus 1.25% expected
For Burger King U.S., same store sales increased 5%, higher than analysts' expectations of 3.10%. This increase comes following a $400 million investment, announced in Sept. 2022, to "increase advertising firepower; drive higher quality restaurant enhancements and remodels; and support ongoing technology and digital investments," the company said in a release.
As of the end of Q4, the company "funded a total of $13 million toward the Fuel the Flame investment and $17 million toward our Royal Reset investment" per the release.
International sales came in lower than expected, up 11%, compared to analyst estimates of a 13.79% increase. Restaurant Brands International credited this increase to driving overall sales this quarter.
Its coffee chain Tim Hortons saw sales increase 9.4%, with sales in Canada specifically up 11%. The company noted Canada showed "strong sales momentum as the team executes against its strategic priorities." Unit growth is up 5.8% year-over-year.

Popeyes parent company names Joshua Kobza new CEO
Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Burger King and more, appointed Joshua Kobza as CEO, effective March 1, 2023.
Elizabeth Doughman
February 15, 2023
HUDSON, WI/USA - JUNE 7, 2019: Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen exterior. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is an American chain of fried chicken fast food restaurants.Wolterk | Bigstock.com
Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Burger King and more, appointed Joshua Kobza as CEO, effective March 1, 2023.
Kobza will replace Jose Cil, who will stay on with RBI for one year as an adviser to assist in the transition.
Over the past 11 years, Kobza has held several senior positions at RBI including chief financial officer (2013-2018), chief technology officer and development officer (2018-2019) and chief operating officer (2019-2023). 
Kobza played an integral role in RBI’s acquisition of Tim Hortons in 2014, Popeyes in 2017 and Firehouse Subs in 2021. Popeyes saw sales soar in 2019, jumpstarting the chicken sandwich wars among foodservice competitors. More recently, Burger King launched three new chicken sandwiches: the Mexican Original Chicken Sandwich, Italian Original Chicken Sandwich and American Original Chicken Sandwich.
He will report to RBI executive chairman, Patrick Doyle.
Doyle stated: "Over the past several years, the Board of Directors has worked with management to build a thoughtful succession plan for key positions, so this is a natural transition for Josh to lead our next phase of growth. Personally, I'm motivated to work with and help such a talented person like Josh as he steps into this new leadership position.”
"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank José for his unwavering dedication and passion for growing our restaurant brands and for the progress we have made, most recently evidenced by our latest quarterly results. José has been an exceptional partner and friend and he has all of our thanks and support as he becomes a valued strategic advisor to the company.”
Kobza added: “"I am excited to lead the company and work closely with our business presidents to put our franchisees at the center of our success and accelerate the growth we know our brands are capable of.”

Restaurant Brands International Announces Leadership Changes to Support Long-Term Growth
Sami Siddiqui has been appointed Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Matt Dunnigan who is leaving the company. Jeff Klein has been appointed as President of Popeyes US and Canada, succeeding Mr. Siddiqui who has led the brand for nearly four years. Thiago Santelmo has been appointed President of International. Mr. Santelmo succeeds David Shear, who will remain with the Company for a year as an advisor and assist in the transition. Today's leadership changes are effective immediately and a new President of EMEA and Chief Marketing Officer ("CMO") for Popeyes will be named at a later date.  
"Sami, Thiago and Jeff are proven, valuable leaders in the company and I'm looking forward to working with them as we deliver on our next phase of growth," said Mr. Kobza. "Sami has deep finance and operational experience which makes him a great partner to our Presidents as we deliver on our growth plans across the company. Thiago has spent his career building master franchisee relationships and working closely with them to develop new markets. This will serve him well as we accelerate net restaurant growth internationally in the coming years. Jeff has two decades of marketing and consumer insight experience with large, well-known brands, and will bring this guest-centered approach to making Popeyes 'Easy to Love' across the US and Canada," continued Mr. Kobza.
Mr. Siddiqui has been at RBI for eleven years, including eight years as brand President for Popeyes in Miami, all of our brands in the Asia Pacific region and Tim Hortons in Toronto. Under his leadership, Popeyes has achieved record levels of sales, restaurant growth, and profitability, recently solidifying the brand as the #2 chicken player in the US. Mr. Siddiqui initially joined the Company as head of finance and investor relations before becoming Brand CFO for Tim Hortons and later Burger King. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Siddiqui worked at Blackstone and has an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Santelmo joined the Company eleven years ago, focusing on growth in Latin America as General Manager and then subsequently President for the region. Mr. Santelmo has also been a leader of the Company's growth in the EMEA region, focusing on new country entries, developing new master franchisee partnerships and has served as President of the region for the last two years. Mr. Santelmo has an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Klein joined the Popeyes leadership team two years ago as Chief Marketing Officer and brings 25 years experience in marketing and consumer insights. Mr. Klein previously was CMO for Little Caesars Pizza and spent 15 years at PepsiCo in senior marketing positions, including Senior Vice President and CMO for PepsiCo Foodservice. Mr. Klein is known for driving product innovation and integrating brand marketing campaigns with strong operational execution.  
"I want to thank David and Matt for their years of service in building our Company and growing our restaurant brands. David established a strong network of global franchisees and dedicated franchise support infrastructure which has contributed to the exciting growth of our international business over the past decade. He has been a great partner and will be a valued strategic advisor to Thiago. Matt secured a strong capital structure and developed a balanced capital allocation framework that now supports the investments you have been seeing us make in our brands. As a result of David and Matt's leadership over the years, we are very well set up for our next period of growth," concluded Mr. Kobza.

Restaurant Brands, parent of Popeyes, Burger King delivers strong Q4 earnings, names new CEO
Brooke DiPalma·Senior Reporter
Updated Tue, Feb 14, 20233 min read
In This Article:
QSR
-0.44%
Restaurant Brands International (QSR) reported Q4 2022 earnings on Tuesday, February 14 before the market open that mostly were in line with expectations.
This quarter, which ended December 31, 2022, same-store sales drove strong results, up 9.40%, in addition to restaurant growth, up 4%. The company also appointed Joshua Kobza (the current COO) as the company's new CEO effective March 1, 2023, as it eyes the future growth plans for its brands which include Tim Hortons, Popeyes, Burger King, and Firehouse Subs. Shares were down in the pre-market following the news.
In a separate release posted to its site, newly appointed Executive Chairman Patrick Doyle said the succession has been in the works for the past several years.
"Over the past several years, the Board of Directors has worked with management to build a thoughtful succession plan for key positions, so this is a natural transition for Josh to lead our next phase of growth," Doyle said. Acknowledging current CEO Cil, he added: "José has been an exceptional partner and friend and he has all of our thanks and support as he becomes a valued strategic advisor to the company."
Here are the restaurant giant's results compared to Wall Street estimates:
Revenue: $1.69 billion versus $1.68 billion expected
Adjusted earnings per share: $0.72 versus 0.74 expected
Same-store sales: up 7.90% versus 7.92%
Tim Hortons same-store sales: up 9.4%% versus 7.19% expected
Burger King same-store sales: up 8.40% versus 8.91% expected
Popeyes same-store sales: up 3.80% versus 3.14% expected
Firehouse Subs same-store sales: up 0.4% versus 1.25% expected
For Burger King U.S., same store sales increased 5%, higher than analysts' expectations of 3.10%. This increase comes following a $400 million investment, announced in Sept. 2022, to "increase advertising firepower; drive higher quality restaurant enhancements and remodels; and support ongoing technology and digital investments," the company said in a release.
As of the end of Q4, the company "funded a total of $13 million toward the Fuel the Flame investment and $17 million toward our Royal Reset investment" per the release.
International sales came in lower than expected, up 11%, compared to analyst estimates of a 13.79% increase. Restaurant Brands International credited this increase to driving overall sales this quarter.
Its coffee chain Tim Hortons saw sales increase 9.4%, with sales in Canada specifically up 11%. The company noted Canada showed "strong sales momentum as the team executes against its strategic priorities." Unit growth is up 5.8% year-over-year.

POPEYES FRANCHISEE PAYS $212K AFTER US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR INVESTIGATION FINDS CHILD LABOR, OVERTIME VIOLATIONS
Children as young as 13 worked in San Francisco Bay Area locations
Employer:      14th St. Chicken Corp., operating as Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits
                        7007 International Blvd.
Oakland, CA 94621                                                                                                     
Investigation findings: An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division found a Popeyes fast-food chain franchisee hired children as young as 13-years-old and minors who worked later and longer than permitted by child labor laws at the employer’s three Oakland, Tracy and Newark locations. Investigators also determined the employer shortchanged workers by depriving them of their overtime earnings for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This is the third time that the division has cited the Oakland-based Popeyes franchisee for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Prior violations involved the Oakland and Tracy restaurants in 2003 and 2022, respectively.
Back Wages Recovered:       $39,826 in unpaid overtime wages for 15 employees
$39,826 in damages for 15 employees                                                                             
                                                $121,104 in civil money penalties for child labor violations
                                                $12,104 in civil money penalties for overtime violations
Quote: “The U.S. Department of Labor is determined to fight child labor violations in all sectors, including the fast-food industry,” said Wage and Hour Division Assistant District Director Alberto Raymond in San Francisco. “Child labor laws protect minors and help ensure young workers enjoy positive workplace experiences without jeopardizing their education.” 
Context: In fiscal year 2023, the Wage and Hour Division found child labor violations in more than 950 investigations, resulting in more than $8 million in penalties assessed to employers. Workers and employers can call the division confidentially with questions and the department can speak with callers in more than 200 languages. For more information about the FLSA and other laws enforced by the agency, contact the division’s toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

How Popeyes Turned Spicy Chicken Into a $1.8 Billion Payday
A brief history of one of America’s most beloved chains

Both TV personality Anthony Bourdain and restaurateur Danny Meyer admit to having a penchant for the spicy fried chicken (and macaroni and cheese) served at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the fast-food chicken juggernaut that logged $268.9 million in revenue in 2016. When the Atlanta-based chain was bought out earlier this week by the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, fans could barely contain themselves, fearing changes to the brand’s recipes or vibe, created by a famously flamboyant founder once referred to as a “homegrown Liberace” by his hometown paper.
Here, now, a brief history of Popeyes, aka how one oddly named fried chicken restaurant soon made its greasy spread across the country:
“So fast you get your chicken before you get your change.”
Popeyes was founded in New Orleans in 1972 by Alvin (Al) C. Copeland Sr., a serial entrepreneur who got his start in the doughnut business. As food historian Andrew F. Smith writes in Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat, “Copeland decided to shift from doughnuts to fast-food chicken when KFC started opening outlets in New Orleans.” By the mid-1970s, Copeland began selling franchises; the first one opened in Baton Rouge in 1976.
According to Popeyes’ documented origin story, Copeland originally named his chicken venture “Chicken on the Run,” but after its initial recipe was deemed to bland for locals’ tastes, he closed up shop, added some heat to his spice mixture, and reopened under a sign that read “Popeyes Mighty Good Fried Chicken.” Its slogan? “So fast you get your chicken before you get your change.” When asked why he didn’t use an apostrophe in the name, Copeland was oft-quoted joking that he was “too poor” to afford one at the time.
Copeland named his chicken restaurant not after the spinach-eating comic strip character, but after Popeye Doyle, Gene Hackman’s character in the 1971 film The French Connection. In 1977, the chicken chain confused things slightly by entering into an agreement to use the comic Popeye and his friends in its ads — a campaign that would last 35 years. The annual $1.1 million contract was terminated in 2012. But it was in the early ‘80s that Popeyes pushed the slogan that would linger in consumers’ memories for decades, even beyond the antics of Popeye the Sailor: “Love that Chicken.”
The company introduced its buttermilk biscuits, now considered a signature menu item, in 1983. (Competitor Kentucky Fried Chicken swapped out its rolls for biscuits around the same time.) Smith notes that when the company hired a firm to conduct a blind taste test between KFC and Popeyes, consumers overwhelmingly preferred the spicy kick of Popeyes, “which encouraged Copeland to employ the slogan: America's Fried Chicken Champ—The Spicy Taste That Can't Be Beat.”
Popeyes has encountered setbacks. In 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy after not being able to pay down nearly $400 million in debt. A year later, thanks to a nimble bit of legal and financial trickery, the company bounced back when it formed America’s Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) and made Popeyes and Church’s Chicken, a new acquisition, subsidiaries. Around this time the company moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. AFC went public in 2001; in 2004, it sold off Church’s.
Meanwhile, after he went bankrupt and lost control of his company, Copeland formed Al Copeland Investments, a group that still operates (sit-down, full-service) restaurants in New Orleans today. But Copeland retained recipe rights, and thus an ongoing cash flow, from his brainchild. He licensed the use of his Popeyes recipes to AFC between 1992 and 2014 for $3.1 million annually. In 2014, AFC bought that ratio of herbs and spices outright for $43 million.
Copeland died, at the age of 64, in 2008. It wasn’t until his obituary was published that Popeyes fans who lived outside of New Orleans learned about the eccentric and high-rolling founder of their favorite chicken chain. According to the Times-Picayune, Copeland was born into poverty, but once Popeyes started minting money, he spent his fortune freely and publicly. Copeland kept speedboats “in a glass-walled showroom... when he wasn't racing them, a Lamborghini sports car parked outside his corporate headquarters.”
Al Copeland Al Copeland Foundation
Copeland’s annual Christmas displays “required sheriff's deputies to direct the traffic” in front of his home in New Orleans suburb. One of his four weddings (they all ended in divorce) included “a model of Cinderella's pumpkin coach.” A Louisiana man through and through, he not only sponsored parade floats during Carnival, he rode on them, too. The New York Times wrote in its obit “Copeland planned for his death by building a family tomb for 14 caskets, with four fluted columns and a bronze double door.” He was larger than life — until the end.
After Copeland’s death, the company renamed itself Popeyes Louisiana Chicken, eschewing its previous names “Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken” and “Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits.” Since 2001, Popeyes has been “the number-two quick service chain based on number of units.”
The spicy chicken chain has no shortage of famous fans aside from Bourdain and Meyer: Universal heroine Beyoncé is known for being a Popeyes stan, as she told Oprah in 2003, so much so that the company gave her a lifetime membership card. Funny lady Ellen DeGeneres appeared in a Popeyes commercial in the ‘80s, and famous person Khloe Kardashian has brought its fried chicken and biscuits onto her private jet. When former San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice starred in a Popeyes commercial earlier this year, he faced a considerable amount of backlash for the tired stereotype he portrayed, but maintains his devotion to the brand.
As soon as word leaked that Restaurant Brands International, the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, was looking into buying Popeyes, fans took to Twitter to express their concern:

@Eater "...what did you do?" pic.twitter.com/3D4QYP5DOW
— Cognac-sama (@donovan_the2nd) February 21, 2017
But should fans worry? One thing that might change after the merger is complete in April 2017 is Popeyes’ chicken quality. At the end of 2016, Burger King and Tim Hortons announced they would begin to curb their use of chicken raised on antibiotics. Even though cult favorite Chick-fil-A has promised to cut antibiotic usage, neither Popeyes nor its biggest competitor, KFC, had yet promised such plans.
Analysts suggest that Burger King and Tim Hortons’ history with menu changes and innovations may also result in alterations to the classic Popeyes menu of fried chicken, biscuits, dirty rice, and macaroni and cheese. But it’s likely that any major menu modifications will happen in markets outside the U.S., where there’s more potential to grow Popeyes’ consumer base. As long as the company doesn’t change that $43 million recipe, fans should make every attempt to remain calm.

Popeye’s Franchise Breaks Settlement Agreement, Labor Board Says
Parker Purifoy
Reporter
Franchise entered into agreement with union in 2022
NLRB says company failed to change unlawful handbook policies
The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that a franchise of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen violated federal labor law and the terms of a settlement with the union representing the restaurant’s workers.
In its decision Tuesday, the board’s Democratic majority found that Florida Pop LLC and Sun Holdings Inc.—which operate Popeyes locations in Florida and Louisiana—broke the terms of a 2022 settlement agreement with the Service Employees International Union. The agreement was reached after the NLRB’s attorneys charged the company with maintaining illegally broad handbook policies and then firing an employee over those provisions.
The board said Florida Pop rehired ...

Popeyes' new chicken sandwich set off a chicken-sandwich war that engulfed America.
Debate over chicken sandwiches dominated social media, while Popeyes locations were mobbed with angry crowds seeking sold-out sandwiches.
Two weeks after the sandwich's launch, Popeyes announced it was officially sold out.
Read on for the highs and lows of the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019.
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
Where were you during the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019?
The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of deep-fried madness for fast-food chicken chains. Popeyes has undeniably been at the center of the chaos, thanks to its remarkably good chicken sandwich.
It was a sandwich that launched a thousand Twitter battles. A menu item that ruined thousands of Popeyes workers' weeks. And, unbeknown to many, a sandwich that many customers had been quietly enjoying for weeks.
Then, on Tuesday, it was all over — for now. Popeyes officially announced that the chicken sandwich sold out, only two weeks after its launch.
Here is the full story of the rise and fall of the most hyped menu item of the year.
The birth of Popeyes' chicken sandwich
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
The chicken sandwich is experiencing a moment in fast food.
This moment began well before Popeyes' new sandwich appeared on menus. Chick-fil-A — which became the third-largest chain in the US by sales in 2018, despite having far fewer locations than most of its rivals — has seen incredible success with its chicken sandwich, something that sparked interest in competitors.
Buffalo Wild Wings and Cracker Barrel started testing new chicken sandwiches. McDonald's franchisees called on the corporate office to make developing a top-tier chicken sandwich its top priority. And Popeyes began developing its own sandwich.

José Cil, the CEO of Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Popeyes, Burger King, and Tim Hortons, said the company noticed growing sales of boneless chicken. At Popeyes, more people were buying tenders. At Burger King, chicken-sandwich sales were up. It was time, executives decided, for Popeyes to have a chicken sandwich of its own.
"It's a segment within quick service that we think is growing and growing for the long term," Cil recently told Business Insider. "It's not just a trend here in the US. We think it's a growing trend in Europe. It's a growing trend in Asia and Latin America."
The launch of a legend
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
Some Popeyes locations started serving the sandwich earlier in 2019, revamping locations to add new equipment, including toasters. In August, Business Insider's Irene Jiang happened to order the sandwich at Popeyes while conducting a chicken-sandwich taste test.
Before the hype, Jiang had the chance to give the Popeyes chicken sandwich a clear-eyed, unbiased review. In her unclouded judgement, Popeyes had created a chicken sandwich that far outpaced its rivals' offerings.
"The chicken was incomparably crispy, juicy, and fresh, and all the elements of the sandwich were well balanced," Jiang wrote. "Each bite was bursting with flavor. And its price tag is also the most appealing — at $4, it's the cheapest sandwich in the lineup."

A few weeks later, Popeyes announced it was launching the chicken sandwich at locations across the US.
Overall, the launch on August 12 was a standard affair. The chain debuted the sandwich at Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a trendy Los Angeles restaurant that previously served chicken sandwiches using fried chicken from Popeyes. Popeyes fans seemed excited, but there was no reason to believe the sandwich would be something the majority of the US would think that much about.
Then the tweets began.
The tweet heard around the world
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
Most early social-media support of Popeyes' chicken sandwich appears to have been a grassroots movement, a rarity in the sea of influencers and sponsored content.

Twitter users sang praises of the Popeyes chicken sandwich. Many set it up as a rival to the reigning chicken-sandwich king, Chick-fil-A, which proudly claims the title of the inventor of the chicken sandwich.
Then, Chick-fil-A — normally a chain with a decidedly uncontroversial social-media presence, in comparison with feistier brands like Wendy's — decided to wade into the Twitter battle. Its weapon of choice: the subtweet.
"Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the ❤️for the original," Chick-fil-A tweeted August 19, a week after the debut of Popeyes' chicken sandwich.
Popeyes quote-tweeted it, adding, "y'all good?"
—Popeyes Chicken (@PopeyesChicken) August 19, 2019
Bruno Cardinali, a marketing executive for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, told The New York Times that the team spent 15 minutes putting together the tweet. And, according to Cardinali, it was this tweet that truly set off the chicken-sandwich wars and Popeyes' personal chicken-sandwich chaos.
Deb Gabor, the CEO of the brand-strategy consultancy Sol Marketing, told Business Insider that Popeyes benefited from comparisons with Chick-fil-A, a chain with a polarizing reputation.
"Popeyes was able to attract so many customers largely through social media and word of mouth because not only did they launch a new product that customers legitimately loved, they got a 'dialogue' started about the chicken sandwiches themselves that rapidly snowballed into a larger conversation about values and beliefs when they took a direct shot at Chick-Fil-A," Gabor said.

Wendy's, Church's Chicken, Shake Shack, and more chains waded into the social-media battle over who had the superior chicken sandwich. After that subtweet, Chick-fil-A went quiet.
Customers jumped into the debate, which quickly escalated into the #ChickenSandwichWars. And these customers began showing up to Popeyes, in droves.
The descent into fried-chicken chaos
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
The first sign people might be getting too excited about Popeyes' chicken sandwich came Tuesday.
The foot-traffic tracker Placer.ai found that visits to Popeyes skyrocketed above the summer baseline average by 67.6% on Tuesday and 103.3% on Wednesday. Locations across the US began running out of sandwiches. Workers were forced to deal with angry mobs of customers looking for their chicken-sandwich fix.
On Wednesday, one Popeyes employee at a Newark, New Jersey, location decided she had enough. She told Business Insider she decided to quit, walking out in the middle of making sandwiches.
"The issue with Popeyes or any fast food is the treatment and the amount of pay that a worker gets," the now former employee said, adding that "the added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing."
The week after Popeyes kicked off the chicken-sandwich wars, five employees from in the US told Business Insider they were putting in long hours, with many working overtime. One employee said their restaurant had shifted to mostly focusing on completing orders, neglecting certain tasks like sweeping and washing dishes for the time being.
"I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo," said an 18-year-old Popeyes crew member in California's Orange County, estimating that he made at least 600 sandwiches on the Saturday after Popeyes' tweet during an 11-hour shift.

As workers struggled to keep up with demand in stores, Popeyes executives realized that shortages were a national problem. Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.
The death of Popeyes' sandwich — for now
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
On August 27, just two weeks after Popeyes introduced the menu item, the chain announced that it was officially off the menu.
"We love that you love The Sandwich," the company tweeted. "Unfortunately we're sold out (for now)."
"We, along with our suppliers, are working tirelessly to bring the new sandwich back to guests as soon as possible," the company told Business Insider.
One worker told Business Insider the issue wasn't chicken at her location — it was the lack of buns. Popeyes executives told The Times that locations ran out of the particular cut of breast meat used to make the sandwich and that the chain would be recruiting new suppliers.
"We are working with suppliers of all components of our sandwich to build up our supply in order to bring back the chicken sandwich as soon as possible," a Popeyes representative told Business Insider.
It seems unlikely that The Sandwich 2.0 will capture the same explosive energy of the Chicken Sandwich War. The past two weeks have been one of the most out-of-control reactions to a menu item that I've seen in six years of covering fast food. No country can continue to hype a chicken sandwich this aggressively for much longer.
Then again, it's a really good sandwich.

Popeyes franchisee pays $212K after US Department of Labor investigation finds child labor, overtime violations
News Brief
POPEYES FRANCHISEE PAYS $212K AFTER US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR INVESTIGATION FINDS CHILD LABOR, OVERTIME VIOLATIONS
Children as young as 13 worked in San Francisco Bay Area locations
Employer:      14th St. Chicken Corp., operating as Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits
                        7007 International Blvd.
Oakland, CA 94621                                                                                                     
Investigation findings: An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division found a Popeyes fast-food chain franchisee hired children as young as 13-years-old and minors who worked later and longer than permitted by child labor laws at the employer’s three Oakland, Tracy and Newark locations. Investigators also determined the employer shortchanged workers by depriving them of their overtime earnings for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This is the third time that the division has cited the Oakland-based Popeyes franchisee for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Prior violations involved the Oakland and Tracy restaurants in 2003 and 2022, respectively.
Back Wages Recovered:       $39,826 in unpaid overtime wages for 15 employees
$39,826 in damages for 15 employees                                                                             
                                                $121,104 in civil money penalties for child labor violations
                                                $12,104 in civil money penalties for overtime violations
Quote: “The U.S. Department of Labor is determined to fight child labor violations in all sectors, including the fast-food industry,” said Wage and Hour Division Assistant District Director Alberto Raymond in San Francisco. “Child labor laws protect minors and help ensure young workers enjoy positive workplace experiences without jeopardizing their education.”

How Popeyes Turned Spicy Chicken Into a $1.8 Billion Payday
A brief history of one of America’s most beloved chains

Both TV personality Anthony Bourdain and restaurateur Danny Meyer admit to having a penchant for the spicy fried chicken (and macaroni and cheese) served at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the fast-food chicken juggernaut that logged $268.9 million in revenue in 2016. When the Atlanta-based chain was bought out earlier this week by the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, fans could barely contain themselves, fearing changes to the brand’s recipes or vibe, created by a famously flamboyant founder once referred to as a “homegrown Liberace” by his hometown paper.
Here, now, a brief history of Popeyes, aka how one oddly named fried chicken restaurant soon made its greasy spread across the country:
“So fast you get your chicken before you get your change.”
Popeyes was founded in New Orleans in 1972 by Alvin (Al) C. Copeland Sr., a serial entrepreneur who got his start in the doughnut business. As food historian Andrew F. Smith writes in Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat, “Copeland decided to shift from doughnuts to fast-food chicken when KFC started opening outlets in New Orleans.” By the mid-1970s, Copeland began selling franchises; the first one opened in Baton Rouge in 1976.
According to Popeyes’ documented origin story, Copeland originally named his chicken venture “Chicken on the Run,” but after its initial recipe was deemed to bland for locals’ tastes, he closed up shop, added some heat to his spice mixture, and reopened under a sign that read “Popeyes Mighty Good Fried Chicken.” Its slogan? “So fast you get your chicken before you get your change.” When asked why he didn’t use an apostrophe in the name, Copeland was oft-quoted joking that he was “too poor” to afford one at the time.
Copeland named his chicken restaurant not after the spinach-eating comic strip character, but after Popeye Doyle, Gene Hackman’s character in the 1971 film The French Connection. In 1977, the chicken chain confused things slightly by entering into an agreement to use the comic Popeye and his friends in its ads — a campaign that would last 35 years. The annual $1.1 million contract was terminated in 2012. But it was in the early ‘80s that Popeyes pushed the slogan that would linger in consumers’ memories for decades, even beyond the antics of Popeye the Sailor: “Love that Chicken.”
The company introduced its buttermilk biscuits, now considered a signature menu item, in 1983. (Competitor Kentucky Fried Chicken swapped out its rolls for biscuits around the same time.) Smith notes that when the company hired a firm to conduct a blind taste test between KFC and Popeyes, consumers overwhelmingly preferred the spicy kick of Popeyes, “which encouraged Copeland to employ the slogan: America's Fried Chicken Champ—The Spicy Taste That Can't Be Beat.”
Popeyes has encountered setbacks. In 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy after not being able to pay down nearly $400 million in debt. A year later, thanks to a nimble bit of legal and financial trickery, the company bounced back when it formed America’s Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) and made Popeyes and Church’s Chicken, a new acquisition, subsidiaries. Around this time the company moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. AFC went public in 2001; in 2004, it sold off Church’s.
Meanwhile, after he went bankrupt and lost control of his company, Copeland formed Al Copeland Investments, a group that still operates (sit-down, full-service) restaurants in New Orleans today. But Copeland retained recipe rights, and thus an ongoing cash flow, from his brainchild. He licensed the use of his Popeyes recipes to AFC between 1992 and 2014 for $3.1 million annually. In 2014, AFC bought that ratio of herbs and spices outright for $43 million.
Copeland died, at the age of 64, in 2008. It wasn’t until his obituary was published that Popeyes fans who lived outside of New Orleans learned about the eccentric and high-rolling founder of their favorite chicken chain. According to the Times-Picayune, Copeland was born into poverty, but once Popeyes started minting money, he spent his fortune freely and publicly. Copeland kept speedboats “in a glass-walled showroom... when he wasn't racing them, a Lamborghini sports car parked outside his corporate headquarters.”
Al Copeland Al Copeland Foundation
Copeland’s annual Christmas displays “required sheriff's deputies to direct the traffic” in front of his home in New Orleans suburb. One of his four weddings (they all ended in divorce) included “a model of Cinderella's pumpkin coach.” A Louisiana man through and through, he not only sponsored parade floats during Carnival, he rode on them, too. The New York Times wrote in its obit “Copeland planned for his death by building a family tomb for 14 caskets, with four fluted columns and a bronze double door.” He was larger than life — until the end.
After Copeland’s death, the company renamed itself Popeyes Louisiana Chicken, eschewing its previous names “Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken” and “Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits.” Since 2001, Popeyes has been “the number-two quick service chain based on number of units.”
The spicy chicken chain has no shortage of famous fans aside from Bourdain and Meyer: Universal heroine Beyoncé is known for being a Popeyes stan, as she told Oprah in 2003, so much so that the company gave her a lifetime membership card. Funny lady Ellen DeGeneres appeared in a Popeyes commercial in the ‘80s, and famous person Khloe Kardashian has brought its fried chicken and biscuits onto her private jet. When former San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice starred in a Popeyes commercial earlier this year, he faced a considerable amount of backlash for the tired stereotype he portrayed, but maintains his devotion to the brand.
As soon as word leaked that Restaurant Brands International, the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, was looking into buying Popeyes, fans took to Twitter to express their concern:

@Eater "...what did you do?" pic.twitter.com/3D4QYP5DOW
— Cognac-sama (@donovan_the2nd) February 21, 2017
But should fans worry? One thing that might change after the merger is complete in April 2017 is Popeyes’ chicken quality. At the end of 2016, Burger King and Tim Hortons announced they would begin to curb their use of chicken raised on antibiotics. Even though cult favorite Chick-fil-A has promised to cut antibiotic usage, neither Popeyes nor its biggest competitor, KFC, had yet promised such plans.
Analysts suggest that Burger King and Tim Hortons’ history with menu changes and innovations may also result in alterations to the classic Popeyes menu of fried chicken, biscuits, dirty rice, and macaroni and cheese. But it’s likely that any major menu modifications will happen in markets outside the U.S., where there’s more potential to grow Popeyes’ consumer base. As long as the company doesn’t change that $43 million recipe, fans should make every attempt to remain calm.

NLRB says company failed to change unlawful handbook policies
The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that a franchise of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen violated federal labor law and the terms of a settlement with the union representing the restaurant’s workers.
In its decision Tuesday, the board’s Democratic majority found that Florida Pop LLC and Sun Holdings Inc.—which operate Popeyes locations in Florida and Louisiana—broke the terms of a 2022 settlement agreement with the Service Employees International Union. The agreement was reached after the NLRB’s attorneys charged the company with maintaining illegally broad handbook policies and then firing an employee over those provisions.
The board said Florida Pop rehired ...

Popeyes' new chicken sandwich set off a chicken-sandwich war that engulfed America.
Debate over chicken sandwiches dominated social media, while Popeyes locations were mobbed with angry crowds seeking sold-out sandwiches.
Two weeks after the sandwich's launch, Popeyes announced it was officially sold out.
Read on for the highs and lows of the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019.
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
Where were you during the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019?
The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of deep-fried madness for fast-food chicken chains. Popeyes has undeniably been at the center of the chaos, thanks to its remarkably good chicken sandwich.
It was a sandwich that launched a thousand Twitter battles. A menu item that ruined thousands of Popeyes workers' weeks. And, unbeknown to many, a sandwich that many customers had been quietly enjoying for weeks.
Then, on Tuesday, it was all over — for now. Popeyes officially announced that the chicken sandwich sold out, only two weeks after its launch.
Here is the full story of the rise and fall of the most hyped menu item of the year.
The birth of Popeyes' chicken sandwich
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
The chicken sandwich is experiencing a moment in fast food.
This moment began well before Popeyes' new sandwich appeared on menus. Chick-fil-A — which became the third-largest chain in the US by sales in 2018, despite having far fewer locations than most of its rivals — has seen incredible success with its chicken sandwich, something that sparked interest in competitors.
Buffalo Wild Wings and Cracker Barrel started testing new chicken sandwiches. McDonald's franchisees called on the corporate office to make developing a top-tier chicken sandwich its top priority. And Popeyes began developing its own sandwich.

José Cil, the CEO of Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Popeyes, Burger King, and Tim Hortons, said the company noticed growing sales of boneless chicken. At Popeyes, more people were buying tenders. At Burger King, chicken-sandwich sales were up. It was time, executives decided, for Popeyes to have a chicken sandwich of its own.
"It's a segment within quick service that we think is growing and growing for the long term," Cil recently told Business Insider. "It's not just a trend here in the US. We think it's a growing trend in Europe. It's a growing trend in Asia and Latin America."
The launch of a legend
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
Some Popeyes locations started serving the sandwich earlier in 2019, revamping locations to add new equipment, including toasters. In August, Business Insider's Irene Jiang happened to order the sandwich at Popeyes while conducting a chicken-sandwich taste test.
Before the hype, Jiang had the chance to give the Popeyes chicken sandwich a clear-eyed, unbiased review. In her unclouded judgement, Popeyes had created a chicken sandwich that far outpaced its rivals' offerings.
"The chicken was incomparably crispy, juicy, and fresh, and all the elements of the sandwich were well balanced," Jiang wrote. "Each bite was bursting with flavor. And its price tag is also the most appealing — at $4, it's the cheapest sandwich in the lineup."

A few weeks later, Popeyes announced it was launching the chicken sandwich at locations across the US.
Overall, the launch on August 12 was a standard affair. The chain debuted the sandwich at Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a trendy Los Angeles restaurant that previously served chicken sandwiches using fried chicken from Popeyes. Popeyes fans seemed excited, but there was no reason to believe the sandwich would be something the majority of the US would think that much about.
Then the tweets began.
The tweet heard around the world
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
Most early social-media support of Popeyes' chicken sandwich appears to have been a grassroots movement, a rarity in the sea of influencers and sponsored content.

Twitter users sang praises of the Popeyes chicken sandwich. Many set it up as a rival to the reigning chicken-sandwich king, Chick-fil-A, which proudly claims the title of the inventor of the chicken sandwich.
Then, Chick-fil-A — normally a chain with a decidedly uncontroversial social-media presence, in comparison with feistier brands like Wendy's — decided to wade into the Twitter battle. Its weapon of choice: the subtweet.
"Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the ❤️for the original," Chick-fil-A tweeted August 19, a week after the debut of Popeyes' chicken sandwich.
Popeyes quote-tweeted it, adding, "y'all good?"
—Popeyes Chicken (@PopeyesChicken) August 19, 2019
Bruno Cardinali, a marketing executive for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, told The New York Times that the team spent 15 minutes putting together the tweet. And, according to Cardinali, it was this tweet that truly set off the chicken-sandwich wars and Popeyes' personal chicken-sandwich chaos.
Deb Gabor, the CEO of the brand-strategy consultancy Sol Marketing, told Business Insider that Popeyes benefited from comparisons with Chick-fil-A, a chain with a polarizing reputation.
"Popeyes was able to attract so many customers largely through social media and word of mouth because not only did they launch a new product that customers legitimately loved, they got a 'dialogue' started about the chicken sandwiches themselves that rapidly snowballed into a larger conversation about values and beliefs when they took a direct shot at Chick-Fil-A," Gabor said.

Wendy's, Church's Chicken, Shake Shack, and more chains waded into the social-media battle over who had the superior chicken sandwich. After that subtweet, Chick-fil-A went quiet.
Customers jumped into the debate, which quickly escalated into the #ChickenSandwichWars. And these customers began showing up to Popeyes, in droves.
The descent into fried-chicken chaos
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
The first sign people might be getting too excited about Popeyes' chicken sandwich came Tuesday.
The foot-traffic tracker Placer.ai found that visits to Popeyes skyrocketed above the summer baseline average by 67.6% on Tuesday and 103.3% on Wednesday. Locations across the US began running out of sandwiches. Workers were forced to deal with angry mobs of customers looking for their chicken-sandwich fix.
On Wednesday, one Popeyes employee at a Newark, New Jersey, location decided she had enough. She told Business Insider she decided to quit, walking out in the middle of making sandwiches.
"The issue with Popeyes or any fast food is the treatment and the amount of pay that a worker gets," the now former employee said, adding that "the added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing."
The week after Popeyes kicked off the chicken-sandwich wars, five employees from in the US told Business Insider they were putting in long hours, with many working overtime. One employee said their restaurant had shifted to mostly focusing on completing orders, neglecting certain tasks like sweeping and washing dishes for the time being.
"I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo," said an 18-year-old Popeyes crew member in California's Orange County, estimating that he made at least 600 sandwiches on the Saturday after Popeyes' tweet during an 11-hour shift.

As workers struggled to keep up with demand in stores, Popeyes executives realized that shortages were a national problem. Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.
The death of Popeyes' sandwich — for now
Popeyes. Irene Jiang / Business Insider
On August 27, just two weeks after Popeyes introduced the menu item, the chain announced that it was officially off the menu.
"We love that you love The Sandwich," the company tweeted. "Unfortunately we're sold out (for now)."
"We, along with our suppliers, are working tirelessly to bring the new sandwich back to guests as soon as possible," the company told Business Insider.
One worker told Business Insider the issue wasn't chicken at her location — it was the lack of buns. Popeyes executives told The Times that locations ran out of the particular cut of breast meat used to make the sandwich and that the chain would be recruiting new suppliers.
"We are working with suppliers of all components of our sandwich to build up our supply in order to bring back the chicken sandwich as soon as possible," a Popeyes representative told Business Insider.
It seems unlikely that The Sandwich 2.0 will capture the same explosive energy of the Chicken Sandwich War. The past two weeks have been one of the most out-of-control reactions to a menu item that I've seen in six years of covering fast food. No country can continue to hype a chicken sandwich this aggressively for much longer.
Then again, it's a really good sandwich.

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.
ADVERTISEMENT
A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

Popeyes fast-food chain closes Oakland franchisee over worker abuse, violence claims
Updated on: May 18, 2023 / 5:26 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco
OAKLAND -- The Popeyes fast-food chain shut down a franchisee in Oakland Thursday following allegations of worker abuse, underage workers and violence at the restaurant.
Two 17-year-old workers at the Popeyes restaurant at 7007 International Blvd. near the Oakland Coliseum on Wednesday filed labor and safety claims with CalOSHA and the state Department of Industrial Relations, alleging an unsafe work environment and claiming management and security guards are not trained to handle ongoing incidents.
Popeyes 7007 International Blvd Oakland - CalOSHA_Redacted by CBS News Bay Area on Scribd
Popeyes 7007 International Blvd Oakland- Child Labor_Redacted by CBS News Bay Area on Scribd
Among the claims, the teenage workers complained of being "subjected to ongoing sexual harassment and workplace violence." Managers were said to be strict with work schedules, compelling teen employees to work long hours during school nights and alleging one co-worker began working at the age of 13, working up to six days a week.
The workers also referred to an incident in February captured in a viral video which shows someone jumping over the counter and assaulting a worker while a person identified as a manager is seen hitting the assailant with a baseball bat. 
CBS News Bay Area has not independently verified the video.
"We do not feel safe at work. Recent violent incidents have shown that not only is management not taking sufficient action to protect us from violence at the store, there is also an urgent lack of training at all levels within the store on de-escalation and how to handle violent situations."
Popeyes told CBS News Bay Area in an email it was investigating the claims.
"Based on the allegations made this morning by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we have immediately shut down his restaurant and have started a swift investigation," the statement said. "We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee."
At the time the Feb. 28 viral video was posted, Popeyes responded with a statement saying, "We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again."
We are horrified to see the events that took place at a Popeyes restaurant in Oakland, CA. We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc. is suing the owners of 52 former franchise restaurants for trademark infringement after the restaurants allegedly continued using the company’s trademarks despite the termination of licensing agreements.
Popeyes says it sent license termination notices to the owners, Florida Pop LLC and Pop Investments LLC and Guillermo Perales, between February and the end of March 2023, according to its complaint filed on Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
The company filed a separate suit in March to enjoin the restaurant owners from using the trademarks. To resolve that case the parties ...

Jury awards $31M in lawsuit against a Popeyes franchisee
A former employee of Sun Holdings had accused the 150-unit Popeyes operator of reneging on a promise of 5% of the annual operating profits.

A jury this week awarded a former employee of Dallas-based Sun Holdings nearly $31 million in damages to a former employee who said the Popeyes operator owed him a share of the restaurants’ profits.
The jury initially awarded $15.6 million in compensatory damages to Jerry Stockton, who had sued Sun Holdings and its owner, Guillermo Perales. The jury then awarded Stockton another $15.1 million in punitive damages.
“The jury correctly concluded that Mr. Stockton had been defrauded by Mr. Perales,” Daniel Charest, an attorney with Burns Charest, the law firm that represented Stockton at trial.
Perales said in an interview that he would appeal.
Sun Holdings is a massive franchisee of multiple brands, including Burger King, Arby’s, Applebee’s, IHOP, Papa John’s and Popeyes.
Stockton had been director of operations and then vice president of operations for the Perales’ 150 Popeyes locations before he retired in 2018.
Stockton sued one year after his retirement, alleging that as the “key operator” for the restaurants, he was entitled to 5% of their operating profits.
He alleged in his lawsuit that he was encouraged to delay taking his share of the operating profits until his retirement. Stockton also alleged that Perales denied his request for those operating profits on multiple occasions.
Perales said in an interview that he hadn’t promised Stockton 5% of the operating profits of the Popeyes units, and that he had been paid a salary and a bonus. He said the issue is rooted in a confusing section of the Popeyes franchise agreement, which says that a “key operator” of the locations is entitled to 5% of the restaurants’ operating profits.
But Perales said that the provision is targeted at investor-owned franchises. Sun Holdings is owned solely by Perales himself. He also argued that the $31 million award was derived from a 38% profit margin for the restaurants, which didn’t factor in costs such as interest and rent.
“It gets so technical that it gets confusing, especially for a jury,” Perales said.

The Popeyes franchise manager "screamed" at federal investigators, the DOL says in a lawsuit.
He cursed at the investigators and slammed a door so hard it shook the building, per the lawsuit.
When investigators previously visited the restaurant, they were told all its staff had gone home sick, per the DOL
When federal investigators visited a Popeyes franchise restaurant in Pennsylvania as part of a probe into its employment practices, a manager screamed curse words at them and slammed the kitchen door so hard it shook the whole building, the US Department of Labor said.
Investigators from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division visited the restaurant in Harrisburg on April 5, and as soon as the district manager arrived on site he began to scream at them, per a civil action filed by the department in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on April 13.
The complaint claims that the district manager "instantly started screaming 'what the f*** are you doing here,' using an aggressive tone and demeanor."
Other comments he made to the investigators included "you think since you have f******* badges you can just walk the f*** in here" and "you are not going to interview nobody, you can stay there all you want," per the lawsuit.
The district manager also slammed the kitchen door "so hard that the entire establishment shook," per the complaint.
His "demeanor, actions, and tone were threatening to the investigators, which caused the investigators to fear for their physical well-being," the DOL wrote.

After holding a closed-door meeting with the employees, the district manager then stood in the doorway between the restaurant staff in the kitchen and the investigators in the dining area. The DOL said that his words and demeanor "made it clear" that he didn't want his staff to speak to the investigators.
The DOL said that when the Wage and Hour Division previously attempted to conduct investigatory interviews on March 14, the general manager told investigators that all the restaurant's employees had gone home sick.

Conner, US District Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, ordered the franchise company and the district manager not to retaliate against staff who speak to federal investigators or tell them to share false information. The judge's preliminary injunction from May 1 also forbids the restaurant from questioning workers about their communications with the investigators.
A case management call has been set up between the judge and the parties for June 7. Popeyes and parent company Restaurant Brands International have not been listed as defendants in the lawsuit.
RBI and lawyers for the district manager and the franchise company did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside of regular US working hours.

Popeyes officially relaunched its wildly popular chicken sandwich on November 3 after selling out of the menu item in August.
The second iteration of the sandwich has been linked to various reports of violence, many stemming from agitated customers who want to get their hands on the coveted menu item.
Police confirmed that a deadly stabbing in Oxon Hill, Maryland, on November 4 was linked to the return of the chicken sandwich.
"There is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot," Popeyes said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities."
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
The Popeyes chicken sandwich is back, and the second iteration of the famed menu has been as wild — if not more — than its first go-around.
Foot traffic to stores surpassed the peak traffic during the original launch of the sandwich, according to foot-traffic tracker Placer.ai.
Since the sandwich relaunched on November 3, there have been various reports of customers resorting to extreme measures to get one of the sandwiches.
"It is as crazy as last time if not more," said a shift leader in a Texas Popeyes who worked through the first iteration of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. He said his location sold over 2,000 sandwiches the first night of the relaunch.
Popeyes said that some locations experienced drive-thru lines down the street and in-store lines that went out the front door.
But in some cases, the hype has become dangerous. A Popeyes employee was arrested on Friday after a viral video showed an employee body-slamming a woman outside a Tennessee restaurant, Fox reported.
A deadly stabbing in Oxon Hill, Maryland the day after the sandwich's relaunch was linked to to the return of the menu item, police confirmed. One man fatally stabbed the other while waiting in line for a Popeyes chicken sandwich after an argument. Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County Police Department, said that the disagreement was apparently sparked when one person cut in front of the other in line.
From a fatal stabbing to a report of a brawl between an employee and a customer, here are all the incidents connected to the Popeyes chicken sandwich so far.

"For you to get that angry over anything, for that type of anger to develop into this type of violence, is a very sad and tragic day," said Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County Police Department.

Another Maryland Popeyes was reportedly the site of a brawl. A spokesperson confirmed to The Baltimore Sun that there was an altercation between an employee and a customer that demanded a refund.

The incident occurred on November 3 and was caught on video. Police reportedly responded to reports of disturbances at that Popeyes location two more times. “None of these incidents appear to be related to the recent release of their chicken sandwich,” Kyle Andersen, a sheriff’s office spokesman, told The Baltimore Sun.

When the sandwich originally debuted in August, violence ensued as well. "I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out," a manager at an East Coast Popeyes told Business Insider in August.

Scott Detrow talks to journalist Jonathan Maze about how fast food chains are vying for chicken sandwich supremacy.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
I have a distinct memory from four years ago this month. I was driving around Nevada covering the presidential campaign, and I was repeatedly pulling up Google Maps. I was not trying to find the campaign rally I was headed to. I was trying to see if I was anywhere near a Popeyes so I could try yet again to find one of their red-hot, brand-new chicken sandwiches.
America's new obsession with chicken sandwiches began four years ago, when Popeyes added one to its menu. It led to the internet losing its mind, and then it quickly led to other competitors rushing out their own. And since then, we have all kept arguing - spicy or original? Pickle or no pickle? Once or double fried?
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) Oh, baby, I got Popeyes.
UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTISTS: (Vocalizing).
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...Sandwich right here. This sandwich right here.
DETROW: And now, Americans are happily caught between the warm slices of brioche bun and plenty of crunchy, juicy options. On average, Americans today eat close to 100 pounds of chicken a year, and you just know a lot of chicken has to be consumed in the form of an oh-so-tasty fried chicken sandwich. Jonathan Maze is editor-in-chief for Restaurant Business magazine, and he joins us from Dallas, where he is attending a restaurant conference. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
JONATHAN MAZE: Thank you for having me.
DETROW: So I think one of the most interesting things is the fact that this has sustained itself. But before we get into that, let's just talk about that original moment four years ago. What do you think it was that made this stick? Just good branding? Like, what do you think happened?
MAZE: You know, it was really a perfect storm. It's hard to really put your finger on exactly what happened. Nothing has ever been quite like that. It was a brilliant tweak. It was a very good sandwich, and then it just took off.
DETROW: And just to remind everybody, it launches in mid-August, and then by this time in 2019, people are lining up around the block. People are rushing. Popeyes sometimes, you know, loses control of the crowds. The chicken sandwiches go scare. Some people were trying to resell them at exorbitant prices - just mania for a chicken sandwich.
MAZE: Yeah. And they ran out in, like, less than two weeks and had to pull it off the menu and then train their restaurants, work the supply chain to get enough supplies for chicken sandwiches. And then they reintroduced it in November, and it continued to go crazy, which blows my mind because if you take a product off the menu, you lose some energy like that. That is what we all thought was going to happen, and it didn't. It was incredible.
DETROW: And then so many other fast-food restaurants try to get in on this to the point where everyone brands it the chicken sandwich wars. Four years later, do you feel like that phrasing is still accurate? Because I still feel like I see - and I often order - chicken sandwiches everywhere I go.
MAZE: Yeah. I think the branding still works. We had somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 restaurant chains, based on our account, that came up with an upgraded chicken sandwich. For a while, it got to the point that you had to have a higher-quality chicken sandwich in the fast-food business if you were going to sell chicken sandwiches. It was a price of doing business.
DETROW: You described right there high-quality chicken sandwiches. I mean, how would you describe that? - because the basic concept of a chicken sandwich is pretty straightforward. But like you said, there was a quality increase. There was a production increase. What is it that makes a chicken sandwich high quality?
MAZE: Well, you have to have sort of whole-breast fillet. You know, you're not really going to overly process it. We had all kinds of efforts on that in terms of how the breading was, how - Burger King came out with one which was hand-breaded on site and very complicated, as it turned out. You have a higher-quality bun, a brioche bun, something along those lines. You just upgraded it from the traditional ingredients that you would find at a fast-food brand, and you had to have a good chicken sandwich, really, or at least that was the thought.
DETROW: I will be fully honest. We purchased a Popeyes chicken sandwich to have in the studio during this conversation, and I decided to take a bite during that answer. I'm sorry.
MAZE: I've had plenty.
DETROW: I think to me, the thing that makes this renaissance of chicken sandwiches is the placement of pickles. I feel like I really appreciate a solid, crispy pickle in the middle of the chicken sandwich.
MAZE: It kind of makes the chicken sandwich. It really does. I mean, the pickle is, in my opinion, a necessity.
DETROW: How have sales been? Because the hype seems to have kept up. You talked about the fact that it's a mainstay on the menu. Are we all still buying as many chicken sandwiches now as we were back then? And how big of a force are they in sales for places like Popeyes?
MAZE: Sure. At Popeyes, the hype died down a bit. You have a lot of competitors in the business, but they still have a higher level of sales overall now than before they came out with their chicken sandwich - quite a bit. It was a big, big deal to Popeyes. It changed the face of that brand, and it is roughly maintained.
DETROW: Do you have a personal favorite? Can you journalistically say what your favorite is?
MAZE: Yeah, I can say.
DETROW: All right. What is it?
MAZE: Shake Shack.
DETROW: Shake Shack.
MAZE: I've been on the record. Shake Shack has the best chicken sandwich - yeah, for sure.
DETROW: I've had that. It's good, very delicious.
MAZE: I just really like the flavor of the sandwich. I mean, I've - I think they could have just almost ditched the burgers at Shake Shack and just came up with Chicken Shack instead.
DETROW: That's Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief for Restaurant Business magazine, joining us from Dallas. Thank you so much.
MAZE: Thank you very much for having me.

The Sad Story Behind 1 Popeyes Franchisee's Bankruptcy
Tony Prato/Shutterstock
BY LAUREN CAHNMARCH 18, 2023 8:04 PM EST
"Brace yourself for the new normal," they said three years ago when the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning. No one knew that quite so well as independent restaurant owners like celebrity chef and "Restaurant Hustle" participant Antonia. Lofaso, who gave Mashed, a window into just how challenging the first year and a half actually became. Now, as the world enters the fourth year of the post-pandemic era, the restaurant industry, overall, is still in search of solid footing.
In late February 2023, a full 92% of restaurant operators surveyed by the National Restaurant Association said that inflation, and particularly the high cost of procuring food, has created significant challenges. Other factors include higher interest rates (which make it harder for restaurants to exercise financial leverage) and difficulty hiring due to an apparently smaller pool of willing restaurant workers. But it's not just independent restaurants feeling the pinch.
Restaurant Brands International (RBI) is the parent of four major quick service restaurant chains (aka fast food joints)& Burger King, Tim Horton's, Firehouse Subs, and Popeyes. Since the beginning of 2023, three franchisees in RBl's vast system have declared bankruptcy, per Restaurant Dive. The first two were the behemoth Burger King franchisees, Toms King and Meridian Restaurants Unlimited. The latest is a Popeyes franchisee, Premier Cajun Kings LLC (PCK).
On March 14, PCK filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in Alabama federal court, according to court papers published on Court Listener. And brace yourself because this is one sad story.
The now bankrupt Popeyes franchisee was run by a seasoned industry veteran
Facebook
By most accounts, it would appear that the sad tale of the bankruptcy of the Popeyes franchisee, PCK, begins with the sudden death of its owner, Manraj "Patrick" Sidhu, who graduated from college (Punjab University) in 1997 and founded the company in 2018, according to court papers filed by David Baker, Managing Director of Aurora Management Partners Inc., the financial consulting and advisory firm retained by PCK to provide crisis management. Starting with just six restaurants in the Birmingham, Alabama area, Sidhu grew that number to 30 locations across Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. Employing nearly 400, the company clocked sales of $30 million in 2020 and 2021
Sidhu wasn't a fast-food chain franchisee novice, however. Starting in 2010, he acquired multiple Burger King locations through the PCK affiliate, Premier Kings, which is still, apparently, a going concern. Additionally, in 2018, he began acquiring Qdoba Mexican Grill and Hummus & Pita Co. locations as well. And that may, in fact, be where things actually began to go awry: By 2021, the last Hummus & Pita had shuttered.
Within less than a year after that, on May 24, 2022, Sidhu was dead. The cause does not appear to have been publicly disclosed. Shortly after, on June 2, Sidhu's estate retained Aurora to see it through what was expected to be a difficult transition, in part because Sidhu was PCK's sole owner and member of management.
The death of its sole owner and manager plunged the Popeyes franchisee into financial disarray

In the wake of the death of its sole owner and manager, PCK, the company that Patrick Sidhu formed in 2018 to become a franchisee of multiple Popeyes restaurants, began hemorrhaging cash, according to a March 14 declaration filed in Alabama federal court. "Due to low performance and increasing losses," Baker stated under penalty of perjury, PCK "made the difficult decision to close 10 [Popeyes] restaurants throughout Alabama and Tennessee in an attempt to avoid further losses and to stabilize the business." In addition, an 11th location lost its lease via an eviction proceeding brought by the landlord — thereby leaving PCK's portfolio of Popeyes restaurants diminished by one-third as of March 14, 2023, the date of the company's bankruptcy filing.
Sadly, however, these closures did not do enough to stabilize PCK's business amid the challenges presented by post-pandemic economic realities, coupled with the loss of the person who was, essentially, the brains behind the entire operation. "Facing increased pressure from landlords, vendors, and its secured lender [PNC Bank]," PKC found itself with no choice but to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Baker declared.
Chapter 11 affords those companies that avail themselves of it, an opportunity to restructure their debts and ultimately reorganize. Although that is the hope of what remains of PKC, the plan going forward will likely be the sale of these Popeyes restaurants to another franchisee.

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.
ADVERTISEMENT
A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

Popeyes fast-food chain closes Oakland franchisee over worker abuse, violence claims
Updated on: May 18, 2023 / 5:26 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco
OAKLAND -- The Popeyes fast-food chain shut down a franchisee in Oakland Thursday following allegations of worker abuse, underage workers and violence at the restaurant.
Two 17-year-old workers at the Popeyes restaurant at 7007 International Blvd. near the Oakland Coliseum on Wednesday filed labor and safety claims with CalOSHA and the state Department of Industrial Relations, alleging an unsafe work environment and claiming management and security guards are not trained to handle ongoing incidents.

Among the claims, the teenage workers complained of being "subjected to ongoing sexual harassment and workplace violence." Managers were said to be strict with work schedules, compelling teen employees to work long hours during school nights and alleging one co-worker began working at the age of 13, working up to six days a week.
The workers also referred to an incident in February captured in a viral video which shows someone jumping over the counter and assaulting a worker while a person identified as a manager is seen hitting the assailant with a baseball bat. 
CBS News Bay Area has not independently verified the video.
"We do not feel safe at work. Recent violent incidents have shown that not only is management not taking sufficient action to protect us from violence at the store, there is also an urgent lack of training at all levels within the store on de-escalation and how to handle violent situations."
Popeyes told CBS News Bay Area in an email it was investigating the claims.
"Based on the allegations made this morning by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we have immediately shut down his restaurant and have started a swift investigation," the statement said. "We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee."
At the time the Feb. 28 viral video was posted, Popeyes responded with a statement saying, "We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again."
We are horrified to see the events that took place at a Popeyes restaurant in Oakland, CA. We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.

COURT: S.D. Fla.
TRACK DOCKET: No. 1:23-cv-23955
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc. is suing the owners of 52 former franchise restaurants for trademark infringement after the restaurants allegedly continued using the company’s trademarks despite the termination of licensing agreements.
Popeyes says it sent license termination notices to the owners, Florida Pop LLC and Pop Investments LLC and Guillermo Perales, between February and the end of March 2023, according to its complaint filed on Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
The company filed a separate suit in March to enjoin the restaurant owners from using the trademarks. To resolve that case the parties ...

Jury awards $31M in lawsuit against a Popeyes franchisee
A former employee of Sun Holdings had accused the 150-unit Popeyes operator of reneging on a promise of 5% of the annual operating profits.

A jury this week awarded a former employee of Dallas-based Sun Holdings nearly $31 million in damages to a former employee who said the Popeyes operator owed him a share of the restaurants’ profits.
The jury initially awarded $15.6 million in compensatory damages to Jerry Stockton, who had sued Sun Holdings and its owner, Guillermo Perales. The jury then awarded Stockton another $15.1 million in punitive damages.
“The jury correctly concluded that Mr. Stockton had been defrauded by Mr. Perales,” Daniel Charest, an attorney with Burns Charest, the law firm that represented Stockton at trial.
Perales said in an interview that he would appeal.
Sun Holdings is a massive franchisee of multiple brands, including Burger King, Arby’s, Applebee’s, IHOP, Papa John’s and Popeyes.
Stockton had been director of operations and then vice president of operations for the Perales’ 150 Popeyes locations before he retired in 2018.
Stockton sued one year after his retirement, alleging that as the “key operator” for the restaurants, he was entitled to 5% of their operating profits.
He alleged in his lawsuit that he was encouraged to delay taking his share of the operating profits until his retirement. Stockton also alleged that Perales denied his request for those operating profits on multiple occasions.
Perales said in an interview that he hadn’t promised Stockton 5% of the operating profits of the Popeyes units, and that he had been paid a salary and a bonus. He said the issue is rooted in a confusing section of the Popeyes franchise agreement, which says that a “key operator” of the locations is entitled to 5% of the restaurants’ operating profits.
But Perales said that the provision is targeted at investor-owned franchises. Sun Holdings is owned solely by Perales himself. He also argued that the $31 million award was derived from a 38% profit margin for the restaurants, which didn’t factor in costs such as interest and rent.
“It gets so technical that it gets confusing, especially for a jury,” Perales said.

The Popeyes franchise manager "screamed" at federal investigators, the DOL says in a lawsuit.
He cursed at the investigators and slammed a door so hard it shook the building, per the lawsuit.
When investigators previously visited the restaurant, they were told all its staff had gone home sick, per the DOL
When federal investigators visited a Popeyes franchise restaurant in Pennsylvania as part of a probe into its employment practices, a manager screamed curse words at them and slammed the kitchen door so hard it shook the whole building, the US Department of Labor said.
Investigators from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division visited the restaurant in Harrisburg on April 5, and as soon as the district manager arrived on site he began to scream at them, per a civil action filed by the department in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on April 13.
The complaint claims that the district manager "instantly started screaming 'what the f*** are you doing here,' using an aggressive tone and demeanor."
Other comments he made to the investigators included "you think since you have f******* badges you can just walk the f*** in here" and "you are not going to interview nobody, you can stay there all you want," per the lawsuit.
The district manager also slammed the kitchen door "so hard that the entire establishment shook," per the complaint.
His "demeanor, actions, and tone were threatening to the investigators, which caused the investigators to fear for their physical well-being," the DOL wrote.
Related stories
After holding a closed-door meeting with the employees, the district manager then stood in the doorway between the restaurant staff in the kitchen and the investigators in the dining area. The DOL said that his words and demeanor "made it clear" that he didn't want his staff to speak to the investigators.
The DOL said that when the Wage and Hour Division previously attempted to conduct investigatory interviews on March 14, the general manager told investigators that all the restaurant's employees had gone home sick.
Christopher C. Conner, US District Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, ordered the franchise company and the district manager not to retaliate against staff who speak to federal investigators or tell them to share false information. The judge's preliminary injunction from May 1 also forbids the restaurant from questioning workers about their communications with the investigators.
A case management call has been set up between the judge and the parties for June 7. Popeyes and parent company Restaurant Brands International have not been listed as defendants in the lawsuit.
RBI and lawyers for the district manager and the franchise company did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside of regular US working hours.

Popeyes officially relaunched its wildly popular chicken sandwich on November 3 after selling out of the menu item in August.
The second iteration of the sandwich has been linked to various reports of violence, many stemming from agitated customers who want to get their hands on the coveted menu item.
Police confirmed that a deadly stabbing in Oxon Hill, Maryland, on November 4 was linked to the return of the chicken sandwich.
"There is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot," Popeyes said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities."
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
The Popeyes chicken sandwich is back, and the second iteration of the famed menu has been as wild — if not more — than its first go-around.
Foot traffic to stores surpassed the peak traffic during the original launch of the sandwich, according to foot-traffic tracker Placer.ai.
Since the sandwich relaunched on November 3, there have been various reports of customers resorting to extreme measures to get one of the sandwiches.
"It is as crazy as last time if not more," said a shift leader in a Texas Popeyes who worked through the first iteration of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. He said his location sold over 2,000 sandwiches the first night of the relaunch.
Popeyes said that some locations experienced drive-thru lines down the street and in-store lines that went out the front door.
But in some cases, the hype has become dangerous. A Popeyes employee was arrested on Friday after a viral video showed an employee body-slamming a woman outside a Tennessee restaurant, Fox reported.
A deadly stabbing in Oxon Hill, Maryland the day after the sandwich's relaunch was linked to to the return of the menu item, police confirmed. One man fatally stabbed the other while waiting in line for a Popeyes chicken sandwich after an argument. Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County Police Department, said that the disagreement was apparently sparked when one person cut in front of the other in line.
From a fatal stabbing to a report of a brawl between an employee and a customer, here are all the incidents connected to the Popeyes chicken sandwich so far.

"For you to get that angry over anything, for that type of anger to develop into this type of violence, is a very sad and tragic day," said Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County Police Department.

The incident occurred on November 3 and was caught on video. Police reportedly responded to reports of disturbances at that Popeyes location two more times. “None of these incidents appear to be related to the recent release of their chicken sandwich,” Kyle Andersen, a sheriff’s office spokesman, told The Baltimore Sun.

Scott Detrow talks to journalist Jonathan Maze about how fast food chains are vying for chicken sandwich supremacy.
Sponsor Message
SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
I have a distinct memory from four years ago this month. I was driving around Nevada covering the presidential campaign, and I was repeatedly pulling up Google Maps. I was not trying to find the campaign rally I was headed to. I was trying to see if I was anywhere near a Popeyes so I could try yet again to find one of their red-hot, brand-new chicken sandwiches.
America's new obsession with chicken sandwiches began four years ago, when Popeyes added one to its menu. It led to the internet losing its mind, and then it quickly led to other competitors rushing out their own. And since then, we have all kept arguing - spicy or original? Pickle or no pickle? Once or double fried?
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) Oh, baby, I got Popeyes.
UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTISTS: (Vocalizing).
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...Sandwich right here. This sandwich right here.
DETROW: And now, Americans are happily caught between the warm slices of brioche bun and plenty of crunchy, juicy options. On average, Americans today eat close to 100 pounds of chicken a year, and you just know a lot of chicken has to be consumed in the form of an oh-so-tasty fried chicken sandwich. Jonathan Maze is editor-in-chief for Restaurant Business magazine, and he joins us from Dallas, where he is attending a restaurant conference. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
JONATHAN MAZE: Thank you for having me.
DETROW: So I think one of the most interesting things is the fact that this has sustained itself. But before we get into that, let's just talk about that original moment four years ago. What do you think it was that made this stick? Just good branding? Like, what do you think happened?
MAZE: You know, it was really a perfect storm. It's hard to really put your finger on exactly what happened. Nothing has ever been quite like that. It was a brilliant tweak. It was a very good sandwich, and then it just took off.
DETROW: And just to remind everybody, it launches in mid-August, and then by this time in 2019, people are lining up around the block. People are rushing. Popeyes sometimes, you know, loses control of the crowds. The chicken sandwiches go scare. Some people were trying to resell them at exorbitant prices - just mania for a chicken sandwich.
MAZE: Yeah. And they ran out in, like, less than two weeks and had to pull it off the menu and then train their restaurants, work the supply chain to get enough supplies for chicken sandwiches. And then they reintroduced it in November, and it continued to go crazy, which blows my mind because if you take a product off the menu, you lose some energy like that. That is what we all thought was going to happen, and it didn't. It was incredible.
DETROW: And then so many other fast-food restaurants try to get in on this to the point where everyone brands it the chicken sandwich wars. Four years later, do you feel like that phrasing is still accurate? Because I still feel like I see - and I often order - chicken sandwiches everywhere I go.
MAZE: Yeah. I think the branding still works. We had somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 restaurant chains, based on our account, that came up with an upgraded chicken sandwich. For a while, it got to the point that you had to have a higher-quality chicken sandwich in the fast-food business if you were going to sell chicken sandwiches. It was a price of doing business.
DETROW: You described right there high-quality chicken sandwiches. I mean, how would you describe that? - because the basic concept of a chicken sandwich is pretty straightforward. But like you said, there was a quality increase. There was a production increase. What is it that makes a chicken sandwich high quality?
MAZE: Well, you have to have sort of whole-breast fillet. You know, you're not really going to overly process it. We had all kinds of efforts on that in terms of how the breading was, how - Burger King came out with one which was hand-breaded on site and very complicated, as it turned out. You have a higher-quality bun, a brioche bun, something along those lines. You just upgraded it from the traditional ingredients that you would find at a fast-food brand, and you had to have a good chicken sandwich, really, or at least that was the thought.
DETROW: I will be fully honest. We purchased a Popeyes chicken sandwich to have in the studio during this conversation, and I decided to take a bite during that answer. I'm sorry.
MAZE: I've had plenty.
DETROW: I think to me, the thing that makes this renaissance of chicken sandwiches is the placement of pickles. I feel like I really appreciate a solid, crispy pickle in the middle of the chicken sandwich.
MAZE: It kind of makes the chicken sandwich. It really does. I mean, the pickle is, in my opinion, a necessity.
DETROW: How have sales been? Because the hype seems to have kept up. You talked about the fact that it's a mainstay on the menu. Are we all still buying as many chicken sandwiches now as we were back then? And how big of a force are they in sales for places like Popeyes?
MAZE: Sure. At Popeyes, the hype died down a bit. You have a lot of competitors in the business, but they still have a higher level of sales overall now than before they came out with their chicken sandwich - quite a bit. It was a big, big deal to Popeyes. It changed the face of that brand, and it is roughly maintained.
DETROW: Do you have a personal favorite? Can you journalistically say what your favorite is?
MAZE: Yeah, I can say.
DETROW: All right. What is it?
MAZE: Shake Shack.
DETROW: Shake Shack.
MAZE: I've been on the record. Shake Shack has the best chicken sandwich - yeah, for sure.
DETROW: I've had that. It's good, very delicious.
MAZE: I just really like the flavor of the sandwich. I mean, I've - I think they could have just almost ditched the burgers at Shake Shack and just came up with Chicken Shack instead.
DETROW: That's Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief for Restaurant Business magazine, joining us from Dallas. Thank you so much.

The Sad Story Behind 1 Popeyes Franchisee's Bankruptcy
Tony Prato/Shutterstock
BY LAUREN CAHNMARCH 18, 2023 8:04 PM EST
"Brace yourself for the new normal," they said three years ago when the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning. No one knew that quite so well as independent restaurant owners like celebrity chef and "Restaurant Hustle" participant Antonia. Lofaso, who gave Mashed, a window into just how challenging the first year and a half actually became. Now, as the world enters the fourth year of the post-pandemic era, the restaurant industry, overall, is still in search of solid footing.
In late February 2023, a full 92% of restaurant operators surveyed by the National Restaurant Association said that inflation, and particularly the high cost of procuring food, has created significant challenges. Other factors include higher interest rates (which make it harder for restaurants to exercise financial leverage) and difficulty hiring due to an apparently smaller pool of willing restaurant workers. But it's not just independent restaurants feeling the pinch.
Restaurant Brands International (RBI) is the parent of four major quick service restaurant chains (aka fast food joints)& Burger King, Tim Horton's, Firehouse Subs, and Popeyes. Since the beginning of 2023, three franchisees in RBl's vast system have declared bankruptcy, per Restaurant Dive. The first two were the behemoth Burger King franchisees, Toms King and Meridian Restaurants Unlimited. The latest is a Popeyes franchisee, Premier Cajun Kings LLC (PCK).
On March 14, PCK filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in Alabama federal court, according to court papers published on Court Listener. And brace yourself because this is one sad story.
The now bankrupt Popeyes franchisee was run by a seasoned industry veteran
Facebook
By most accounts, it would appear that the sad tale of the bankruptcy of the Popeyes franchisee, PCK, begins with the sudden death of its owner, Manraj "Patrick" Sidhu, who graduated from college (Punjab University) in 1997 and founded the company in 2018, according to court papers filed by David Baker, Managing Director of Aurora Management Partners Inc., the financial consulting and advisory firm retained by PCK to provide crisis management. Starting with just six restaurants in the Birmingham, Alabama area, Sidhu grew that number to 30 locations across Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. Employing nearly 400, the company clocked sales of $30 million in 2020 and 2021
Sidhu wasn't a fast-food chain franchisee novice, however. Starting in 2010, he acquired multiple Burger King locations through the PCK affiliate, Premier Kings, which is still, apparently, a going concern. Additionally, in 2018, he began acquiring Qdoba Mexican Grill and Hummus & Pita Co. locations as well. And that may, in fact, be where things actually began to go awry: By 2021, the last Hummus & Pita had shuttered.
Within less than a year after that, on May 24, 2022, Sidhu was dead. The cause does not appear to have been publicly disclosed. Shortly after, on June 2, Sidhu's estate retained Aurora to see it through what was expected to be a difficult transition, in part because Sidhu was PCK's sole owner and member of management.
The death of its sole owner and manager plunged the Popeyes franchisee into financial disarray

In the wake of the death of its sole owner and manager, PCK, the company that Patrick Sidhu formed in 2018 to become a franchisee of multiple Popeyes restaurants, began hemorrhaging cash, according to a March 14 declaration filed in Alabama federal court. "Due to low performance and increasing losses," Baker stated under penalty of perjury, PCK "made the difficult decision to close 10 [Popeyes] restaurants throughout Alabama and Tennessee in an attempt to avoid further losses and to stabilize the business." In addition, an 11th location lost its lease via an eviction proceeding brought by the landlord — thereby leaving PCK's portfolio of Popeyes restaurants diminished by one-third as of March 14, 2023, the date of the company's bankruptcy filing.
Sadly, however, these closures did not do enough to stabilize PCK's business amid the challenges presented by post-pandemic economic realities, coupled with the loss of the person who was, essentially, the brains behind the entire operation. "Facing increased pressure from landlords, vendors, and its secured lender [PNC Bank]," PKC found itself with no choice but to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Baker declared.
Chapter 11 affords those companies that avail themselves of it, an opportunity to restructure their debts and ultimately reorganize. Although that is the hope of what remains of PKC, the plan going forward will likely be the sale of these Popeyes restaurants to another franchisee.

Court forbids Popeyes franchisee, manager from intimidating workers, harassing federal investigators during investigation of Harrisburg restaurant
News Release
COURT FORBIDS POPEYES FRANCHISEE, MANAGER FROM INTIMIDATING WORKERS, HARASSING FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS DURING INVESTIGATION OF HARRISBURG RESTAURANT
Motion alleges district manager cursed at investigators, slammed door
HARRISBURG, PA – A federal court has issued a preliminary injunction in response to the U.S. Department of Labor’s request to enjoin and restrain the owner of a Popeyes franchise restaurant in Harrisburg and its district manager from threatening workers, harassing federal investigators, and otherwise obstructing an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division.
The action by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania comes during the division’s probe into possible Fair Labor Standards Act violations by Jonestown Rd Chicken LLC, owner of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen at 4601 Jonestown Road in Harrisburg.   
In its complaint, the department alleged that on April 5, 2023, the restaurant’s general manager contacted the company’s district manager, Tom Rudzenski, to come to the establishment immediately after division investigators arrived. While they waited for his arrival, the general manager made sure employees stayed in the back of the kitchen area to prevent them from having an opportunity to speak with investigators.
Once Rudzenski arrived, the district manager cursed loudly at investigators, acted aggressively and then slammed the kitchen door numerous times with such force it was felt throughout the building. Then, after a closed-door meeting in the kitchen with employees, Rudzenski stood in the doorway between employees in the kitchen and investigators in the public area. While standing between the employees and the investigators, Rudzenski made it clear, through his words and demeanor, that he did not want the employees to speak to the investigators.
This scene was not the first time the restaurant’s management tried to stop the department from speaking with the restaurant’s workers. A few weeks earlier, on March 14, 2023, investigators saw employees working at the restaurant and asked to conduct interviews, but the general manager claimed the employees had gone home sick.  
“The demeanor and actions of the district manager for this Popeyes franchisee in Harrisburg raised concerns among our investigators about their physical safety, and the workers there must have felt threatened and were likely afraid to lose their jobs if they spoke to our investigators,” said Wage and Hour Division District Director Alfonso Gristina in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. “Despite the prohibited conduct of the restaurant’s general manager and the franchise’s district manager, the Wage and Hour Division will not be stopped from completing its investigation.”
The court’s order temporarily forbids Jonestown Rd Chicken LLC and Rudzenski from violating the FLSA’s anti-retaliation provisions, and from further harassing and threatening their workers and division investigators. It also requires that the employer notifies their employees of their rights to freely speak with investigators or otherwise cooperate with the division’s investigation.
“The Fair Labor Standards Act protects employees’ rights to participate in and cooperate with Wage and Hour Division investigations without fear of employer retaliation and intimidation. The U.S. Department of Labor will take effective and expeditious legal action on behalf of workers when their employers violate their rights or attempt to obstruct an investigation,” said Deputy Regional Solicitor Samantha Thomas in Philadelphia.
Learn more about the Wage and Hour Division, including regulations prohibiting retaliation and a search tool to use if you think you may be owed back wages collected by the division. Employers and workers can call the division confidentially with questions regardless of their immigration status.

Standing water causes Springfield fast food restaurant to temporarily close over weekend
Susan Szuch
Springfield News-Leader
A Springfield fast food restaurant had to temporarily close this week while it dealt with standing wastewater in its kitchen, according to reports from the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.
Popeye's at 1710 S. Glenstone Ave. had to close over Labor Day Weekend, according to an Aug. 30 report. A blocked floor drain resulted in standing gray water in the kitchen starting Aug. 29. Gray water is wastewater that does not include human sewage, but can potentially contain bacteria or viruses as well as detergents, bleach or salts, according to the University of Missouri Extension. On Aug. 31, inspectors returned to find that the wastewater situation was solved and allowed the restaurant to re-open.
Issues found during inspection fall into either priority or non-priority violations. Priority violations impact the safety of the food, such as cross-contamination between raw and ready-to-eat food, improper food temperature and poor personal hygiene and employee health. Multiple priority violations can lead to an establishment being shut down. Non-priority violations alone do not directly affect food safety, such as dirty floors, sticky tabletops or outside trash cans not being covered.
Food inspections take place one to three times a year, depending on the type of food served, the population served, difficulty of food preparation and past history. Restaurants preparing food from raw ingredients are inspected more often "than convenience stores that serve only non-potentially hazardous foods, such as popcorn and soda," according to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.

Updated 11 a.m. Saturday
A Popeyes fast-food franchisee has paid $212,000 for child labor and wage violations at its restaurants in East Oakland, Newark and Tracy, federal regulators announced this week.
Minors under 14 years old are not allowed to work at food service establishments. But the company, 14th Street Chicken, hired children as young as 13 and had minors working longer hours than permitted by law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
Johmara Romero, who alerted workplace regulators about those problems last year as a 17-year-old cashier at the employer’s Oakland location, said the risk she took as a whistleblower “was worth it.”
‘From what I’ve heard, there’s a lot more people speaking up now. I feel like that’s good because you shouldn’t keep quiet about stuff that shouldn’t be going on at work. … You have to speak up.’
Johmara Romero, former cashier, Popeyes in Oakland
“From what I’ve heard, there’s a lot more people speaking up now,” said Romero, who is now 18 and working as a grocery store cashier. “I feel like that’s good because you shouldn’t keep quiet about stuff that shouldn’t be going on at work. … You have to speak up.”
Romero told KQED she observed colleagues as young as 13 working late into the night, almost to midnight, which interfered with their learning at school. Romero spoke publicly about other workplace violations, too, alleging she and other minors experienced sexual harassment by managers who made crude jokes.
Following her allegations, Romero said her hours were cut, and she left the job.
In addition to the child labor violations, Department of Labor investigators found that 14th Street Chicken shortchanged workers by not paying them overtime earnings.

The agency recovered nearly $80,000 in unpaid wages and damages for 15 employees, most of whom have received restitution, a spokesperson said.
“The U.S. Department of Labor is determined to fight child labor violations in all sectors, including the fast-food industry,” Wage and Hour Division Assistant District Director Alberto Raymond said in a statement. “Child labor laws protect minors and help ensure young workers enjoy positive workplace experiences without jeopardizing their education.”
Workers Accuse an East Oakland Popeye’s of Child Labor Violations
This is the third time the department has cited the Oakland-based Popeyes franchisee for breaking labor laws.
A spokesperson for Popeyes said the brand “takes issues like this very seriously.”
“Based on the allegations made in early 2023 by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we immediately shut down the restaurant to conduct a swift investigation and to remediate the issues that were identified,” said the spokesperson in a statement. “We’ve been staying close with this franchisee, and to our knowledge there have been no further violations.”
The employer paid additional penalties totaling $4,300 for citations last year by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) and the Labor Commissioner’s Office, according to a spokesperson with the Department of Industrial Relations, which oversees both agencies.
Nationwide, the Department of Labor assessed more than $8 million in penalties to employers after finding 5,800 kids employed in violation of child labor laws in 2023, a nearly 50% increase from the year before.
This story was updated to include statements by Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. and the California Department of Industrial Relations, which were provided after the story published on Feb. 8.

Robinson Township Popeye’s ordered to close for violations found during inspection

ROBINSON TOWNSHIP, Pa. — A fast-food restaurant in an Allegheny County community was forced to close because several violations were found during a recent inspection.
The Allegheny County Health Department ordered the Popeye’s on Steubenville Pike in Robinson Township to close after an inspection on Tuesday.
A report from the health department shows inspectors found one high-risk violation: improper washing, rinsing or sanitizing dishes and grease accumulation on a shelf above the sink. Both of these violations were considered repeat violations.
There were also several lower-risk violations, according to the report, like a lack of hot water in bathrooms (also a repeat violation), a blocked mop sink and the certified manager’s failure to prevent high and medium-risk repeat violations.
A re-inspection date has not been scheduled yet.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (CNN Newsource/WMC/WKRC) - Popeyes has temporarily closed one of its locations after a former employee posted a viral video showing filthy, roach-infested conditions.
Roaches could be seen all around the restaurant, from food packaging to the deep fryers. Former employee Tykeia Ransom said that for nearly two months she had to work with roaches swarming the restaurant.
"Got a roach in the rice," said Ransom.

Ransom said that the roaches weren't the only unsanitary problem they had to deal with. She said that food, specifically bins of chicken, would be left out on the floor.
She also said that she tried multiple times to bring these issues up to management.
"I even got into it with the GM over the roaches being in the rice. Like, we got into it bad, she didn't even wanna throw it away she was like 'this is product,' I was like 'oh okay, but it has roaches in it. I'm not gonna serve that,'" said Ransom.
Ransom's video went viral and then one day later the Tennessee Department of Health did a "routine inspection" and gave the restaurant a score of 98.

There was only two violations listed, neither of them had anything to do with bugs.
This prompted corporate officials for Popeyes to release a statement.
"Even though the health department visited yesterday and confirmed no issues at the restaurant located at 4720 Showcase Boulevard, we shut it down. We thoroughly cleaned and will not reopen until we understand what happened and team members have been retrained on proper procedures."

Local media reached out to try and find out when the location would reopen but there was no response.

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.
ADVERTISEMENT
A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

Two 17-year-old workers at the Popeyes restaurant at 7007 International Blvd. near the Oakland Coliseum on Wednesday filed labor and safety claims with CalOSHA and the state Department of Industrial Relations, alleging an unsafe work environment and claiming management and security guards are not trained to handle ongoing incidents.

Among the claims, the teenage workers complained of being "subjected to ongoing sexual harassment and workplace violence." Managers were said to be strict with work schedules, compelling teen employees to work long hours during school nights and alleging one co-worker began working at the age of 13, working up to six days a week.
The workers also referred to an incident in February captured in a viral video which shows someone jumping over the counter and assaulting a worker while a person identified as a manager is seen hitting the assailant with a baseball bat. 
CBS News Bay Area has not independently verified the video.
"We do not feel safe at work. Recent violent incidents have shown that not only is management not taking sufficient action to protect us from violence at the store, there is also an urgent lack of training at all levels within the store on de-escalation and how to handle violent situations."
Popeyes told CBS News Bay Area in an email it was investigating the claims.
"Based on the allegations made this morning by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we have immediately shut down his restaurant and have started a swift investigation," the statement said. "We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee."
At the time the Feb. 28 viral video was posted, Popeyes responded with a statement saying, "We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again."
We are horrified to see the events that took place at a Popeyes restaurant in Oakland, CA. We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.

Court forbids Popeyes franchisee, manager from intimidating workers, harassing federal investigators during investigation of Harrisburg restaurant
News Release
COURT FORBIDS POPEYES FRANCHISEE, MANAGER FROM INTIMIDATING WORKERS, HARASSING FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS DURING INVESTIGATION OF HARRISBURG RESTAURANT
Motion alleges district manager cursed at investigators, slammed door
HARRISBURG, PA – A federal court has issued a preliminary injunction in response to the U.S. Department of Labor’s request to enjoin and restrain the owner of a Popeyes franchise restaurant in Harrisburg and its district manager from threatening workers, harassing federal investigators, and otherwise obstructing an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division.
The action by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania comes during the division’s probe into possible Fair Labor Standards Act violations by Jonestown Rd Chicken LLC, owner of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen at 4601 Jonestown Road in Harrisburg.   
In its complaint, the department alleged that on April 5, 2023, the restaurant’s general manager contacted the company’s district manager, Tom Rudzenski, to come to the establishment immediately after division investigators arrived. While they waited for his arrival, the general manager made sure employees stayed in the back of the kitchen area to prevent them from having an opportunity to speak with investigators.
Once Rudzenski arrived, the district manager cursed loudly at investigators, acted aggressively and then slammed the kitchen door numerous times with such force it was felt throughout the building. Then, after a closed-door meeting in the kitchen with employees, Rudzenski stood in the doorway between employees in the kitchen and investigators in the public area. While standing between the employees and the investigators, Rudzenski made it clear, through his words and demeanor, that he did not want the employees to speak to the investigators.
This scene was not the first time the restaurant’s management tried to stop the department from speaking with the restaurant’s workers. A few weeks earlier, on March 14, 2023, investigators saw employees working at the restaurant and asked to conduct interviews, but the general manager claimed the employees had gone home sick.  
“The demeanor and actions of the district manager for this Popeyes franchisee in Harrisburg raised concerns among our investigators about their physical safety, and the workers there must have felt threatened and were likely afraid to lose their jobs if they spoke to our investigators,” said Wage and Hour Division District Director Alfonso Gristina in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. “Despite the prohibited conduct of the restaurant’s general manager and the franchise’s district manager, the Wage and Hour Division will not be stopped from completing its investigation.”
The court’s order temporarily forbids Jonestown Rd Chicken LLC and Rudzenski from violating the FLSA’s anti-retaliation provisions, and from further harassing and threatening their workers and division investigators. It also requires that the employer notifies their employees of their rights to freely speak with investigators or otherwise cooperate with the division’s investigation.
“The Fair Labor Standards Act protects employees’ rights to participate in and cooperate with Wage and Hour Division investigations without fear of employer retaliation and intimidation. The U.S. Department of Labor will take effective and expeditious legal action on behalf of workers when their employers violate their rights or attempt to obstruct an investigation,” said Deputy Regional Solicitor Samantha Thomas in Philadelphia.

Employers and workers can call the division confidentially with questions regardless of their immigration status.

Standing water causes Springfield fast food restaurant to temporarily close over weekend
Susan Szuch
Springfield News-Leader
A Springfield fast food restaurant had to temporarily close this week while it dealt with standing wastewater in its kitchen, according to reports from the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.
Popeye's at 1710 S. Glenstone Ave. had to close over Labor Day Weekend, according to an Aug. 30 report. A blocked floor drain resulted in standing gray water in the kitchen starting Aug. 29. Gray water is wastewater that does not include human sewage, but can potentially contain bacteria or viruses as well as detergents, bleach or salts, according to the University of Missouri Extension. On Aug. 31, inspectors returned to find that the wastewater situation was solved and allowed the restaurant to re-open.
Issues found during inspection fall into either priority or non-priority violations. Priority violations impact the safety of the food, such as cross-contamination between raw and ready-to-eat food, improper food temperature and poor personal hygiene and employee health. Multiple priority violations can lead to an establishment being shut down. Non-priority violations alone do not directly affect food safety, such as dirty floors, sticky tabletops or outside trash cans not being covered.
Food inspections take place one to three times a year, depending on the type of food served, the population served, difficulty of food preparation and past history. Restaurants preparing food from raw ingredients are inspected more often "than convenience stores that serve only non-potentially hazardous foods, such as popcorn and soda," according to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.

Updated 11 a.m. Saturday
A Popeyes fast-food franchisee has paid $212,000 for child labor and wage violations at its restaurants in East Oakland, Newark and Tracy, federal regulators announced this week.
Minors under 14 years old are not allowed to work at food service establishments. But the company, 14th Street Chicken, hired children as young as 13 and had minors working longer hours than permitted by law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
Johmara Romero, who alerted workplace regulators about those problems last year as a 17-year-old cashier at the employer’s Oakland location, said the risk she took as a whistleblower “was worth it.”
‘From what I’ve heard, there’s a lot more people speaking up now. I feel like that’s good because you shouldn’t keep quiet about stuff that shouldn’t be going on at work. … You have to speak up.’
Johmara Romero, former cashier, Popeyes in Oakland
“From what I’ve heard, there’s a lot more people speaking up now,” said Romero, who is now 18 and working as a grocery store cashier. “I feel like that’s good because you shouldn’t keep quiet about stuff that shouldn’t be going on at work. … You have to speak up.”
Romero told KQED she observed colleagues as young as 13 working late into the night, almost to midnight, which interfered with their learning at school. Romero spoke publicly about other workplace violations, too, alleging she and other minors experienced sexual harassment by managers who made crude jokes.
Following her allegations, Romero said her hours were cut, and she left the job.
In addition to the child labor violations, Department of Labor investigators found that 14th Street Chicken shortchanged workers by not paying them overtime earnings.

The agency recovered nearly $80,000 in unpaid wages and damages for 15 employees, most of whom have received restitution, a spokesperson said.
“The U.S. Department of Labor is determined to fight child labor violations in all sectors, including the fast-food industry,” Wage and Hour Division Assistant District Director Alberto Raymond said in a statement. “Child labor laws protect minors and help ensure young workers enjoy positive workplace experiences without jeopardizing their education.”

This is the third time the department has cited the Oakland-based Popeyes franchisee for breaking labor laws.
A spokesperson for Popeyes said the brand “takes issues like this very seriously.”
“Based on the allegations made in early 2023 by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we immediately shut down the restaurant to conduct a swift investigation and to remediate the issues that were identified,” said the spokesperson in a statement. “We’ve been staying close with this franchisee, and to our knowledge there have been no further violations.”
The employer paid additional penalties totaling $4,300 for citations last year by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) and the Labor Commissioner’s Office, according to a spokesperson with the Department of Industrial Relations, which oversees both agencies.
Nationwide, the Department of Labor assessed more than $8 million in penalties to employers after finding 5,800 kids employed in violation of child labor laws in 2023, a nearly 50% increase from the year before.
This story was updated to include statements by Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. and the California Department of Industrial Relations, which were provided after the story published on Feb. 8.

Robinson Township Popeye’s ordered to close for violations found during inspection

ROBINSON TOWNSHIP, Pa. — A fast-food restaurant in an Allegheny County community was forced to close because several violations were found during a recent inspection.
The Allegheny County Health Department ordered the Popeye’s on Steubenville Pike in Robinson Township to close after an inspection on Tuesday.
A report from the health department shows inspectors found one high-risk violation: improper washing, rinsing or sanitizing dishes and grease accumulation on a shelf above the sink. Both of these violations were considered repeat violations.
There were also several lower-risk violations, according to the report, like a lack of hot water in bathrooms (also a repeat violation), a blocked mop sink and the certified manager’s failure to prevent high and medium-risk repeat violations.
A re-inspection date has not been scheduled yet.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (CNN Newsource/WMC/WKRC) - Popeyes has temporarily closed one of its locations after a former employee posted a viral video showing filthy, roach-infested conditions.
Roaches could be seen all around the restaurant, from food packaging to the deep fryers. Former employee Tykeia Ransom said that for nearly two months she had to work with roaches swarming the restaurant.
"Got a roach in the rice," said Ransom.

Ransom said that the roaches weren't the only unsanitary problem they had to deal with. She said that food, specifically bins of chicken, would be left out on the floor.
She also said that she tried multiple times to bring these issues up to management.
"I even got into it with the GM over the roaches being in the rice. Like, we got into it bad, she didn't even wanna throw it away she was like 'this is product,' I was like 'oh okay, but it has roaches in it. I'm not gonna serve that,'" said Ransom.
Ransom's video went viral and then one day later the Tennessee Department of Health did a "routine inspection" and gave the restaurant a score of 98.

There was only two violations listed, neither of them had anything to do with bugs.
This prompted corporate officials for Popeyes to release a statement.
"Even though the health department visited yesterday and confirmed no issues at the restaurant located at 4720 Showcase Boulevard, we shut it down. We thoroughly cleaned and will not reopen until we understand what happened and team members have been retrained on proper procedures."

Local media reached out to try and find out when the location would reopen but there was no response.

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.

A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

Popeyes fast-food chain closes Oakland franchisee over worker abuse, violence claims
Updated on: May 18, 2023 / 5:26 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco
OAKLAND -- The Popeyes fast-food chain shut down a franchisee in Oakland Thursday following allegations of worker abuse, underage workers and violence at the restaurant.
Two 17-year-old workers at the Popeyes restaurant at 7007 International Blvd. near the Oakland Coliseum on Wednesday filed labor and safety claims with CalOSHA and the state Department of Industrial Relations, alleging an unsafe work environment and claiming management and security guards are not trained to handle ongoing incidents.

Popeyes 7007 International Blvd Oakland- Child Labor_Redacted by CBS News Bay Area on Scribd
Among the claims, the teenage workers complained of being "subjected to ongoing sexual harassment and workplace violence." Managers were said to be strict with work schedules, compelling teen employees to work long hours during school nights and alleging one co-worker began working at the age of 13, working up to six days a week.
The workers also referred to an incident in February captured in a viral video which shows someone jumping over the counter and assaulting a worker while a person identified as a manager is seen hitting the assailant with a baseball bat. 
CBS News Bay Area has not independently verified the video.
"We do not feel safe at work. Recent violent incidents have shown that not only is management not taking sufficient action to protect us from violence at the store, there is also an urgent lack of training at all levels within the store on de-escalation and how to handle violent situations."
Popeyes told CBS News Bay Area in an email it was investigating the claims.
"Based on the allegations made this morning by team members at a restaurant owned by one of our franchisees, we have immediately shut down his restaurant and have started a swift investigation," the statement said. "We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee."
At the time the Feb. 28 viral video was posted, Popeyes responded with a statement saying, "We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again."
We are horrified to see the events that took place at a Popeyes restaurant in Oakland, CA. We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants. We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.

Popeyes #13204 on O'neal Lane Baton Rouge, La 70816.
I recently visited the Popeyes at 13204 O'Neal Lane in Baton Rouge, LA, and had a wonderful experience. I encountered a small issue with my coupon, but the manager, Ms. Krystal, handled it with great professionalism. She quickly resolved the situation, ensured my order was complete, and took care of other patrons' concerns with equal attention. Since moving to the O'Neal Lane area, I've consistently found this Popeyes to serve crispy, fresh, and hot chicken. Their dedication to both excellent food and customer service is truly commendable.
Thanks

Waited over an hour for the food and something as simple as requesting thigh pieces only was a task as no one at this place knew what this was. How can a shop that sells and promotes chicken not know the difference in the cuts?

Disappointed
great and fresh food everytime. very expensive but understandable as it is an American restaurant. however, i have ordered hot bbq chicken wings and found hairs on them, completely put us off. rest of the food was fine, however still very disappointed as i’ve never had a bad experience with popeyes until now.

I went to the Popeyes on Auburn in Rockford, Illinois and I tried to order several items that they said we don’t have that we don’t have that. Literally like six different items they did not have. She wasn’t very polite and it was just ridiculous to be honest, I ended up getting one chicken leg and a biscuit because that’s about the only food they had.

GREAT JOB Turnersville, NJ Store!
I just left the store in Turnersville, NJ #11418. What a pleasant experience! The store was immaculate! The server Laila that waited on us was very pleasant and mannerly as well as the entire staff. I asked to speak to the manager and complemented the server, the staff, the presentation of the facility and promised to write a review. Oh! The food was good too! Bravo!

Best Fried Chicken
Best fried chicken spot by a mile as compared to the rest, their spicy chicken sandwich, cajun fries, biscoff milkshake is my go to order and hands down is the best quality of chicken sandwich. Do try out their biscuit with gravy as well.

Always visit the place and try it out. All the time the outlets are open for feedbacks, though a bit pricey but worth every penny.

Unprofessional & ridiculous behavior
I went to Popeyes chicken on E. Washington street in Indianapolis. I was ignored at the counter for approximately 4 minutes before being greeted by "yep". I ordered & it took almost 25 minutes to get my order. While I was waiting, I listened to the employees laughing, talking loudly, sharing phone pictures/videos, and cursing repeatedly. I am a professional Chef & I was completely appalled by the behavior of the employees. One of the contributors was the manager! Unacceptable!!!! I love Popeyes, but I will NOT go back to this particular store...Unprofessional & ridiculous...

Popeyes New Street Birmingham not worth it.
So Popeyes open in Birmingham UK on new street recently so i thought id go and have a see what it was like. Considering there's a KFC, Wing Stop, Nandos and GDK on the same strip id was expecting a decent meal, oh how i was mistaken.

Ordered a BBQ Louisiana box with two tenders and a coleslaw, and after a 15 min wait and the server forgetting to give me my cup for the drink i took it back to the office.

Ill start positive the tenders were very good, and thats that. Chips were chewy and almost cold, the burger was disappointing, whilst the chicken was good it was smothered in BBQ and Mayo on both sides which made it sickly, some one thought putting three slices of cucumber on it was a good idea, they were wrong, soggy and covered in sauce not pleasant to eat.

The picture of the coleslaw on the kiosk looked really good, what was in the pot was not. overly mayoed and I've had better from the pound shop. definitely not what it looked like in its picture.

Wont be going back as i paid £14.98 for a really lack lustre lunch and there's plenty of better places to go.

Popeyes in Torrevieja…
Tried the new Popeyes in Torrevieja next to Carrefour. Food was terrible. The chicken nuggets/pieces were awful, the fries were very few and disgusting. Their idea of salad was a lot of lettuce in a box with 2 thin slices of tomatoes on top covered in the crispy coating they must use for the chicken. The burger was very small too. We were given another box of lettuce with bits of cheese on top that we didn't even order. This disgusting meal cost just over 27 euros!! As for the staff......bad attitude and didn't really know what they were doing. Lesson learnt! Won't be going back ever!!

Popeyes in Williamsport..Upsetting!
Popeyes in Williamsport pa was absolutely terrible tonight with their customer service! Went through the drive through and ordered a wing combo meal and wasn’t even asked what drink I’d like but had a total.. Not sure why or when they thought it was okay to give me a total without asking what side or drink I’d like. Then after the food was gotten, a wing was outside of the container! Very disappointed!

Good food but the drive through service is terrible at 4815 Lebanon Pk, Hermitage TN. Their drive thru has two lanes but one lane is not getting handled. After I finally was served (after backing up and switching to the other drive thru lane) I paid my money and then waited 15 minutes because they didn't have any chicken. Seems like they don't have any managers.

I have tried many times to get in touch with someone here, you will not speak to any of your customers, you make them text you. This is ridiculous. I am also contacting the BBB for a refund. This is absurd the way you people act. You take almost $60.00 and won't even talk to me to try to make it right. I want my money back asap.

Tried Popeye's for the first and last time today. The Mac n cheese is disgusting...nothing like soggy overcooked noodles soaked with what is supposed to be cheese but is good knows what. The chicken tenders are borderline ok but seriously even at a measley13.00 I got ripped off.

Popeyes Montgomery AL
June 5th, 2024
The only reason Montgomery locations get a 1 is when you can get food it is good. I gone to my last Popeyes as the service is horrible and too much time to get this food. I have given the locations too many chances Went to two locations today to get a sandwich and neither could serve me a too back up Went to another chicken sandwich location and was in a out in minutes with a fresh hot sandwich and they were 3 times busier. Goodbye Popeyes.

Omg! Omg! The Popeyes at Belleville Crossing has the worst customer service of all times. The entire staff needs to be fired. They all rude. From that girl name TT their managers on down is the worse. I swear this is absolutely the worst treatment you can receive. They all have bad attitudes they never speak They wait time is unbelievable long. I mean it's like a nightmare going in there. Pleeeaaase hire a new crew.

I have ate at Popeyes for years and am very angry. I have always gotten a 2peice dinner with a breast and a wing. Today I was told I could only get a breast and thigh. I do not eat thighs. You have just lost a frequent customer. Also my husband ordered the same a few weeks ago for me at work and I got a leg and thigh instead. Horrible service in Columbus ms.

I have been in Michigan 13 years now and never had a good experience with Popeyes. Customer service is ghetto and rude. They always get my order wrong, even after they call my order back to me. Something is always missing in my order. Not sure how any of these people were hired. Never seen anything like it in my life.

Tiny chicken
April 19th, 2024
Drumstick about the size of a wing, thigh not much bigger than a nugget. Never seen such small pieces before and I'm wondering where in the world you can buy it like these tiny "tots". At Marysville WA Popeyes Chicken.

I think it was a rip off by Popeyes Xhicken

Food POISONING
April 10th, 2024
Went to Popeyes on Friday April 5,2024 and ordered the fish sandwich and ended up getting sick with food poisoning went to my PCP and it was food poisoning the worst thing that could happen to anyone. I guess you're never safe at restaurants like Popeyes or any other fast food joint. You take your life into your own hands. Stop serving the fish sandwich!

A score of 1 is being generous
April 12th, 2024
I very much like their spicy tenders and until recently visited twice weekly. The Orange City, Florida location has declined in quality of product and certainly service. The staff is rude, obviously hate their job, and the customers they serve. I visited today and before I paid asked if everything i ordered was available. I learned to ask because they are almost always out of something. Even though I was told they had everything, it wasn't. The clerk got very upset that I wanted to cancel my order. I just walked out.

Molded lemon pepper chicken wings
April 13th, 2024
I bought 3 boxes of 12 pieces wings both lemon pepper and sweet and sour. I kept seeing blue spot on the wings. My son ate almost 2 containers and vomited 3 times. When I looked closely at the spots they were MOLD. When I went back in the morning to get a refund she asked me for the molded food. I replied why to reserve it. She asked me to leave the store or get arrested. This is disgusting 🤢 she recommended that I leave instead of giving me a full refund. Now my son feels horrible and my belly was upset all night. Then my son googled molded chicken at Popeyes and there are actually several others who caught the Mold on camera before eating it all. Oh my goodness!

Don't try to contact Popeyes customer service
April 3rd, 2024
I had a Popeyes store that was great buy then they got a new manager and it was terrible I ordered chicken and got a chicken neck instead of a leg. No napkins, no diet sweetener for the tea. I tried to call Popeyes customer service but all I got was a text AI bot. Worthless and time consuming with no help. Looks like they no longer respect their customers so sad I liked their food. But I will be fine without it.

Wtf is this!? JUNK!
March 2nd, 2024
I don't understand all the raves I've heard about this chicken. Ate there for the first time and I ordered some tenders. They were absolutely tasteless. No herbs or spices, pieces were small and over cooked. Biscuits had more taste but unfortunately, it was salty tasting... a biscuit.
My daughter got the "signature" wings. Looked good but she almost chipped a tooth when she tried to bite into them. I could've taken chunks from the chicken and loaded them into my muzzle loader and used it as ammo. Just $#*!ty all the way around. Won't be ever eating there again. I'll stick with KFC!

Never Again
April 28th, 2022
I remember when Popeyes was good food and happy to get it. I sit in a Popeyes at this moment in Ft Worth Texas and have vowed to myself never again will I spend a dime at Popeyes. Ordered Cajun fish. Watered down lemonade unappetizing three pieces of fish that looked worse than gas station fried fish served in a plain container. As soon as I saw it, it screamed" I am not gonna be any good for you" wished I had listened and just walked away from it. Bad to no taste - think elementary school food on a bad day. Hard to understand cashier. Popeyes - you cannot go down in chicken grease flames soon enough. Last dollar you will ever get from me or my family I promise. Man, you stink. But really. I could eat better from my own trash can. Feel sad for what you have become. What happened to you?

Nottingham Popeye's is great.
I have been to the Nottingham Popeye's twice, the restaurant is clean and well decorated. The chicken is tasty and the service is great.

I was greeted warmly and politely. The manager took my order and made good suggestions. The food came quickly and was well presented. They came to check on me and that's why I'd recommend them.

I visited this restaurant for the first time, not too disappointing I will say but not the best, just an average 'American' restaurant. Majority of staff were friendly but one staff member in particular was rude and blunt. Very rude and inconsiderate. Popeyes, hire friendlier staff if you want customers to come back. Thankyou

I'm a fast-food reporter who tried Popeyes' fried chicken for the first time, and it's my new favorite menu item

Erin McDowell/Insider
I've tried a lot of fast-food items in my day, from burgers at McDonald's and Burger King to every burrito at Taco Bell.
However, I've somehow never tried Popeyes' famous fried chicken.
I ordered a four-piece chicken combo and thought it was perfectly juicy and crispy.
As a person who tries and tests fast food for a living, I've tasted most menu items at the chains I have available to me.
I was excited to try Popeyes' fried chicken for the very first time. Erin McDowell/Insider
In fact, I've eaten pretty much every menu item at Popeyes in both my personal life and for work. However, I've surprisingly never tried the chain's signature fried chicken. 
Whenever I've ordered Popeyes in the past, I've opted for either the much-beloved chicken sandwich, the chain's chicken tenders, or even the popcorn shrimp. Somehow, the chain's fried chicken has never called my name — until now.
I decided to try out Popeyes' fried chicken to see if it would become my new go-to order and whether it measured up to other items I've ordered from the chain in the past.
A four-piece chicken combo, which comes with four pieces of fried chicken, a biscuit, a side of your choice, and a drink, came to $12.49.

The box of chicken was heavy — I was impressed with how much food I received for the price.
I ordered Cajun fries with my meal, in addition to a Diet Coke.
My box of fried chicken, Cajun fries, and a biscuit. Erin McDowell/Insider
I've ordered the chicken tender combo from Popeyes before, so I was familiar with how the box comes packed with fries. I had to dig a little into the box to reach the fried chicken, but when I did I noticed that the serving size was bigger than I expected.
The box was supposed to come with four pieces of fried chicken, but my meal actually came with an extra wing.

The extra piece was a pleasant surprise, but I was more excited to see how the fried chicken would actually taste.
The fried chicken was super crispy on the outside.

Large crystal-like clumps of fried batter coated the outside. It looked almost as if it had been dipped in cornflakes, it was so crunchy. The batter is apparently the same one used for the chain's chicken tenders, but the fried chicken appeared to be even crispier.
Inside, the meat was unbelievably moist and flavorful.

The fried outer shell had the perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness, with a buttery flavor that brought it all together. It was super crunchy without being greasy — a quality of perfect fried chicken. 
Out of every piece I tried, I liked the wings the least and the leg the most.

All of the pieces of chicken were fried the same amount, but some obviously had more meat than others. This isn't a criticism, just a fact.
The drumstick was my second favorite piece.

It was super juicy and had a ton of meat inside, despite being one of the smaller pieces.
By the time I got to the fried chicken thigh, I was stuffed — and I didn't even eat the whole pieces of chicken.

I thought that the bang for your buck at Popeyes was unbeatable. For less than $13, I could have easily split this meal with another person, or even two.
I thought this was an exceptional deal, especially considering a five-piece chicken tenders meal costs $14.99. I felt I got way more meat with the fried chicken than I ever did when I ordered chicken tenders.
The Cajun fries were well seasoned and perfectly fluffy.

They complemented the fried chicken well, but next time I might order coleslaw instead for a fresher flavor and more acidity to offset the rich fried chicken.
Overall, I was highly impressed by the fried chicken from Popeyes. I would definitely order it again.

In fact, after trying almost every item on the Popeyes menu at this point, the fried chicken might just be my favorite. It was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and the amount of food I received was amazing for the price.
Although the chicken sandwich will always have a place in my heart, I liked the fried chicken better. I also thought it beat the chicken tenders in terms of bang for your buck.
It might have been my first time eating Popeyes' fried chicken, but it definitely won't be my last.

Every Popeyes Menu Item, Ranked Worst To Best
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
BY KRISTINA MANENTEUPDATED: SEPT. 8, 2023 11:48 AM EST
Once called Chicken on the Run, what we know today as Popeyes was opened in 1972 by Alvin C. Copeland Sr., serving up spicy New Orleans-style spicy fried chicken. By 1985 he would be opening his 500th restaurant in Landover, Maryland, a far ways a way from Louisiana. He went through a few name changes, from Popeyes Mighty Good Fried Chicken to Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, (with other names sprinkles in there, too) before settling on Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. However, what remained constant was the crispy fried chicken. 
The recipes for Popeyes' signature chicken and other offerings are so important and vital to the success of the restaurant, that after Copeland died, they had to buy them from his family. For a whopping 43 million dollars. That's some expensive chicken. It's served them well, however. Popeyes has never been more popular, and with lines out the door for their chicken sandwich, you know their food is good.
But what's the best food from Popeyes? Not everything they're serving up is as good as the next menu item — in fact, there are quite a few items you should probably just skip. This is our ranking of Popeyes food, from worst to best.
16. Popeyes Red Beans and Rice
Facebook
Red beans and rice is a defining dish of New Orleans. They love their kidney beans. One of the first real recipes on how to make kidney beans appeared in The Picayune's Creole Cook Book that came about at the turn of the 19th century. So it makes sense for Popeyes to have a red bean and rice dish. But just because they have it, doesn't mean it's good.
When even the restaurant's description for this side is more or less just the name of the dish, you know it's not going to be very exciting. Sure, Popeyes Red Beans and Rice is unique when it comes to fast food sides, but there's nothing to write home about here. The rice is seasoned, like mostly everything at Popeyes is, and then is mixed with red beans that have a smokey flavor. Cool? The smokey flavor comes from liquid smoke, not actual slow cooking, and the rice is always cooked well, but it's just rice — nothing special.
15. Popeyes Cajun Rice
Facebook
Maybe rice shouldn't be a fast food thing. Especially when it comes off as more of a novelty menu item than anything else. Dirty rice, which is what Popeyes' Cajun Rice emulates, is a dish with a deep, rich, yet also dark history in Louisiana. Typically made from the discarded organ meats of the chicken and rice, dirty rice was a slave dish that was both filling and tasted good, but still paled to what was being served in the main house of plantations. Still, over decades it became more of a staple dish for the poor, and is now considered one of Louisiana's most authentic dishes.
And then there's Popeyes' version. The chain relies on its Cajun spices and flavor to carry their version of dirty rice, but it falls short of the real thing. The rice is fine, but it's not that flavorful on its own. It does contain some meat in its Cajun meat sauce, including ground chicken gizzards, but a lot of it is preservatives. If you want dirty rice, treat it right and make it yourself.
14. Popeyes Mashed Potatoes with Gravy
Facebook
The only thing worth eating in this side dish from Popeyes is the Cajun Gravy. That stuff is tasty. The mashed potatoes, however, are meh at best. They're mashed potatoes. There's nothing about them that makes them stand out or be memorable at all (unlike what they serve at another chicken place). That gravy however, we wish Popeyes would bottle it separate and sell. Alas, asking for extra gravy often results in not so great customer experiences, making us more apt to suffer through our gravy-less potatoes. Some people feel the gravy is a bit too oily for their taste, but it all comes down to gravy preferences.
The gravy is made with smoked pork, as well as ground beef, bell peppers, and turkey. Meanwhile the mashed potatoes are heavy on the butter and milk, but they also contain shortening, which can give them an odd sort of texture. You can get better mashed potatoes elsewhere, is what we're saying.
13. Popeyes Coleslaw
Facebook
If you're going to Popeyes to get your greens, you're doing it wrong. That said, coleslaw is delicious and can be quite refreshing when you need to cut through all the fried goodness. Popeyes bills their coleslaw as a "cool, crisp, and tangy treat," and while it isn't bad, we must admit it's a touch lacking when it comes to the realm of coleslaw. 
There is some uniqueness to the typical cabbage and carrots meets mayonnaise when it comes to the coleslaw at Popeyes however. The addition of pickles sets it apart and does add a nice tang to each bite. The lemon juice enhances that, while the small addition of paprika and turmeric gives it some color and a touch more flavor.
We don't hate the coleslaw from Popeyes... but we do know that we can get a much better bowl of this crisp and refreshing side dish if we head down the road to KFC. And for that reason, it's pretty far to the bottom of this list.
12. Popeyes Green Beans
Facebook
Ok, hear us out. We know what you're thinking. Who goes to Popeyes and gets green beans? Smart people do. Because these green beans with turkey bacon are delicious. They're easily the best side offered at Popeyes, bar the biscuits. With a creamy gravy mixed in, and added bacon, this is definitely one of the most nutritious items on the menu. While you're unlikely to go to Popeyes to be healthy, it's at least good to know it's an option, right? While there's nothing astounding happening with Popeyes' green beans, if you like the vegetable, you're probably going to enjoy this version.
The green beans and (that tasty gravy they're swimming in) do contain pork, chicken, and turkey, so that smokey meaty flavor you get from these beans isn't fake. That said, this definitley isn't a vegetarian dish — just in case the chunks of bacon didn't give that away. 
11. Popeyes Cinnamon Apple Pie
Facebook
Popeyes is no stranger to desserts. They have a rotating stock based on seasons, holidays, and what-have-you. From banana pudding parfait to Mardi Gras cheesecake, each of these offerings has had its highs and lows. That said, the reigning king of Popeyes desserts is easily the cinnamon apple pie. It has all the best parts of apple pie in a perfect pocket. The crust is warm and crispy and doused in cinnamon sugar, while the inside is a not-to-sweet apple filling with even more cinnamon. It's a cinnamon explosion that is perfectly satisfying, especially on a cool day.
If you're not a cinnamon fan, chances are you probably won't be thrilled with Popeyes version of the quintessential American dessert. There are a lot of fast food apple pies out there, and everyone has a different opinion on the best one. But if you trust us, it's this one.
10. Popeyes Biscuits
Instagram
Many people will say that you cannot go to Popeyes and not get a biscuit. It's kind of the law. First introduced in 1983, the buttermilk biscuits have become a staple of the Popeyes menu ever since. They're buttery, flaky and crumbly, soft and delicate, and can fit into your mouth in one go if you're really dedicated to it. Some people eat them plain, others make a chicken sandwich with them, while others wait until they're drenched with gravy, red beans, and whatever other sides they have on hand.
People love these biscuits so much there are hundreds of copycat recipes online, but why bother when they actually came out with a mix for you to make them at home? How nice of them. Sometimes Popeyes even has fun with their biscuits, like making them heart-shaped for National Buttermilk Biscuit Day. Yes, that's a real thing. Biscuits are important, people.
9. Popeyes Blackened Tenders
Instagram
You may not immediately realize these are available on the menu, as the default for Popeyes tenders is the fried version, but you can ask for your three-, five-, or 10-piece tenders to come as blackened. Typically associated with Cajun cooking, blackened chicken (or any meat really) basically means that it's cooked to replicate the taste of a charcoal grill without actually being cooked on charcoal. The trick is in the seasoning and technique.
Popeyes' Blackened Tenders are particularly popular with the Keto crowd. What makes them ketogenic friendly (and generally low-carb) is that the chicken is tossed in Popeyes Cajun seasoning and then fried without any of the breading. This mimics the traditional blackening technique of covered meat in spices and then cooking on a hot pan. Popeyes just substitutes its fryer for the skillet, meaning it makes for a relatively healthy meal at a fast food chain. That is, if you skip the sauce. If you're not doing keto and just want some nice smokey delicious chicken tenders, you'll love these as well!
8. Popeyes Boneless Wings
Instagram
You may be thinking this is heresy, eating boneless wings, but wait until you've popped a few of these bad boys in your mouth until you complain. Not quite a nugget, but not quite an actual wing, Popeyes boneless wings are delicious, crispy morsels of breast meat perfect for sauce dipping and snacking. Popeyes Boneless Wings came about after the 2017 chicken wing shortage, and were originally a limited edition deal, but have been back a few times since then and as of November 2019, they're a permanent menu item. Since then they've had multiple iterations from smokehouse, to honey mustard, and Cajun sparkle. Sometimes they even come with tater tots. Tater tots!
What makes these boneless bites so good is that they're just as juicy and crispy as the tenders and signature chicken, but they're bite-sized and are prime for dipping. Popeyes' range of sauces, including BBQ, hot and spicy, honey mustard, smokey ranch, and more.
7. Popeyes Cajun Fries
Instagram
You know how when you go to fast food place and order a meal, the fries are just the side you order because, well, that's what they have? Popeyes has a wide selection of sides, but we'd still choose their fries any day of the week. Move over boring old fried potatoes, there's something better out in Louisiana. 
Popeyes' Cajun Fries are a must with any meal from the fast food giant. Made with their special seasoning, these fries are as flavorful as they are spicy. It just adds more pizzazz to your meal, while also being an entirely respectable snack on its own. Sometimes Popeyes' Cajun Fries get a bit of a makeover as well, like the time they were loaded up with cheddar cheese, bacon, and gravy.
One drawback is that they lose their crisp awfully fast. If you don't made slightly soggy fries, then no harm, no foul, but most of us get a bit bummed when our crispy fried potatoes are no longer crispy.
6. Popeyes Mild Chicken Tenders

Chicken tenders aren't just for kids you know. These all-white breast meat strips of chickeny goodness are crispy and delightful for all ages. The tenders get their own special seasoning, meaning they have a slightly different flavor profile from the signature chicken's blend. These are the mild version, however, so don't worry if you can't pack on the spice. There's another chicken tender for that.
This may catch you off guard, but the regular chicken tenders are actually the lowest in fat of Popeyes fried chicken offerings. At only about 148 calories per strip, that's not too shabby. Well, for fast food anyhow. Throughout the years there have been many iterations of the chicken tenders, including a version fried in waffle batter. 
One of the best parts of eating tenders is dipping them in sauce. The options at Popeyes are plentiful, what with six Signature Sauces including: Bayou Buffalo, Barbeque, Sweet Heat, Mardi Gras Mustard, Buttermilk Ranch, and Blackened Ranch. So many sauces, so little time.
5. Popeyes Handcrafted Spicy Tenders
YouTube
If you're a chicken tender lover, but still want that New Orleans-style spice, never fear, the Handcrafted Spicy Tenders are here. These also get their own special seasoning, including some cayenne to pack in the heat. It's that extra layer of spice that makes the spicy tenders just a bit better than the original chicken tenders. After all, most people come to Popeyes for the flavorful chicken. Treat yourself. 
If they end up being a touch too spicy, you can always cool your mouth down with one of the many dipping sauces that Popeyes has. The ones that pair best with the spicy tenders would be Buttermilk Ranch and Blackened Ranch, if you want a bit of smoke in there as well. Like the mild chicken tenders, the spicy version has had a few cousins on the menu here and there. This includes the Hot Honey Crunch Chicken Tenders.
4. Popeyes Voodoo Tenders
Instagram
Popeyes comes out with limited edition offerings all the time, but most of them pass on without any real fan base. These Voodoo Chicken Tenders though? We would fight for these. Not only do you get three or five of Popeyes delicious chicken tenders with each order, but they pack a major flavor punch with their drizzling of ghost pepper, garlic, fried green onions. Add in that Voodoo Sauce and it's spicy, sweet, and salty is everything you need in your mouth (and life). 
They're not for everyone,though. Ghost peppers are typically over 1 million on the Scoville scale for spiciness (that's up to 400 times hotter than a jalapeno by the way), and while you won't be biting right into one, these tenders do pack a punch. The sweetness of the sugar and pineapple in the sauce balances it out though, so don't be afraid to try these if you haven't yet (and if they're still available).
3. Popeyes Popcorn Shrimp
Instagram
You may not think of getting a seafood dish at a place known for their fried chicken above all else. However, you'd be making a mistake. Popeyes does seafood well. Especially when it comes to their shrimp items. The popcorn shrimp are tender, juicy, and perfectly spiced while also have that trademark crunch when you bite into them. Popeyes' Butterfly Shrimp are incredible, but sadly they're a limited edition summer item that really needs to be on the regular menu all year round. Please, Popeyes?
A big drawback is that you can't get the popcorn shrimp a la carte anymore. When they first came out you could buy them separately. However, these days they're only available in a meal deal. However, if you've got someone who wants your sides while you inhale these delicious morsels, you've got a great deal. Also, sometimes the popcorn shrimp come in fun shapes.
2. Popeyes Signature Chicken
Instagram
Ah, the classic. The chicken that started it all. Popeyes Signature Chicken is great. There's just something about the smell of the spices and grease that gets the blood flowing and the stomach growling, isn't there? Ever since the "Love That Chicken" tagline originated in 1980, people have been singing the praises of Popeyes Signature Chicken. Regardless of whether you're a wing person, a breast person, or a drumstick person, you'll love the crunch of their famous batter. Popeyes marinates their chicken for 12 hours, which is rather noteworthy for a fast food chain. It just goes to show that they don't skimp on quality here. The result is that the chicken is juicy and moist. No dry fried chicken to be found here!
Popeyes also requires that anyone who supplies chicken to them adhere to the animal guidelines from the National Chicken Council. As the company isn't directly involved in raising the chickens they use, they do regular audits of their suppliers and their methods.
1. Popeyes Chicken Sandwich
Facebook
Could it have been anything else? There's a reason Popeye's Chicken Sandwich sold out nationwide for months. There's a reason outlets have gone nuts over its announced return. It's amazing. People have even been killed over it. Originally, Popeye's produced and budgeted enough chicken sandwiches to last through the end of September from its August 12 release, but it went through them twice as fast because everyone wanted a bite. There's plenty of opinions about where the Popeye's chicken sandwich ranks among its competitors, most notoriously against Chick-fil-A's. One bite and there's really no question. Popeye's reigns supreme. It's just that good, people.
Perfectly fried and with crisp buttermilk batter, it's hugged between two buttery brioche buns and the just right amount of mayonnaise and pickles. The spicy version has cayenne thrown into the mix as well. While the original  release of the sandwich caused a social media meltdown over a rush to get it, some customers believe the second release isn't as good, nor as large in size, as the first. Having sampled many since it's return, we can't say that we agree. It's just as good as the first time around. In fact, we'll probably eat even more.

Look, it's fast food. I've only been to the drive thru. There's not much to say about the ambiance. It's a Popeyes. But compared to Church's or KFC? It's just so much better. And their wings are legit as good as or better than fried wings at any sports bar.
Generally the folks at the drive thru are nice and it doesn't take too long to get through the line.
So why am I writing this? Because I think everyone needs to know that the wings are not typical fast food wings. You could serve them at your Super Bowl party and no one would know.

Popeyes fell short of expectations. I ordered the 5 piece tender combo with cajun fries, a frozen mango lemonade, a cinnamon apple pie, and a biscuit through Uber Eats. While the meal arrived on time and was properly packaged, the food quality was disappointing.

The chicken tenders were a mix between hard, dry and under cooked. The biscuits one was doughy and the other dry. The fries were cold and limp. The lemonade had a hint of mango taste and mostly watery. The only redeeming quality was the apple pie filling, but even that was overshadowed by an overly dusted cinnamon and sugar-fried dough.
Overall, it was a disappointing experience.

Order
5 Pc Tender Combo with Cajun Fries $14.99
Frozen Mango Lemonade (upcharge $0.88)
Cinnamon Apple Pie - $2.36
1 Biscuit - $1.61

Food is great. But Service is always meh. Always Slow. I ate in to make sure my order was right. Homeless folk in the dining area made it a little uncomfortable however. The sandwich was good but I wish I had gotten the chicken even though it's kinda expensive.

Just went to the Popeys at 2554 Kingsland Blvd, Katy TX 77492 #11383.
The service was really bad. The person that took my order was the manager and she could not speak or understand English. All the people inside spoke spanish.
I would ask her the price of something and she would just repeat what I said. Several times she just keep repeating what I said to her. She finally got someone over that could speak some english and he told me what the price was. If you are going to have these popeys you should have someone to beable to speak and understand English. Bad Service over all....

The wings are ordered online. When I arrived they were soft not Krispy at all. Like soft chicken for smothering. I informed the counter staff and she replied it would be 5 mins. I waited about 8 minutes to only see the cook take the old chicken in the pan from the light warmer take it to the fryer area pick it up no gloves to re-drop that same soft chicken. I asked for a refund they stated I needed to call the number on the receipt are because not placed at the store--. The bottom line still trying to sell old chicken.. Health dept please visit here

The service is horrible. The management is so rude, every other fast food place in this area has Great customer service. They talk about people in Spanish. I would not go here if you don't want your day to be upsetting by a business who is franchise. I have called corporate and they can't reach him. The owner does not care at all.The Manager fired all the blacks and yall wonder why all the Mexican are taking over employment. They become rude managers and hire only Mexican.

This is the second time I've gotten garlic parmesan flavored wings from the Tomball location, that were made with spicy chicken wings. There won't be a third time. I don't want spicy chicken wings, I want garlic parmesan wings! Why is it that they use spicy chicken for something that isn't supposed to be spicy? I like Popeye's chicken, but I do not like spicy foods as I get really bad heartburn from it. Another issue that I have is that they seem to consistently under-cook the chicken. The meat should not still be pinkish and rubbery after cooking. Salmonella anyone? I will just start going to the Pinehurst Popeye's as I have never had an issue with that location.

Popeyes #13204 on O'neal Lane Baton Rouge, La 70816.
I recently visited the Popeyes at 13204 O'Neal Lane in Baton Rouge, LA, and had a wonderful experience. I encountered a small issue with my coupon, but the manager, Ms. Krystal, handled it with great professionalism. She quickly resolved the situation, ensured my order was complete, and took care of other patrons' concerns with equal attention. Since moving to the O'Neal Lane area, I've consistently found this Popeyes to serve crispy, fresh, and hot chicken. Their dedication to both excellent food and customer service is truly commendable.
Thanks

Waited over an hour for the food and something as simple as requesting thigh pieces only was a task as no one at this place knew what this was. How can a shop that sells and promotes chicken not know the difference in the cuts?

I went to the Popeyes on Auburn in Rockford, Illinois and I tried to order several items that they said we don’t have that we don’t have that. Literally like six different items they did not have. She wasn’t very polite and it was just ridiculous to be honest, I ended up getting one chicken leg and a biscuit because that’s about the only food they had.

I ate lunch today at the pflugerville tx restaurant, I will probably never go back. I paid $10.27 for a 2 piece meal I asked for a leg and thigh oh my goodness I think they are cooking Cornish hens or canaries. That chicken was so tiny I felt like I was eating a snack not a meal and $10.27 wow

GREAT JOB Turnersville, NJ Store!
I just left the store in Turnersville, NJ #11418. What a pleasant experience! The store was immaculate! The server Laila that waited on us was very pleasant and mannerly as well as the entire staff. I asked to speak to the manager and complemented the server, the staff, the presentation of the facility and promised to write a review. Oh! The food was good too! Bravo!

Best Fried Chicken
Best fried chicken spot by a mile as compared to the rest, their spicy chicken sandwich, cajun fries, biscoff milkshake is my go to order and hands down is the best quality of chicken sandwich. Do try out their biscuit with gravy as well.

Always visit the place and try it out. All the time the outlets are open for feedbacks, though a bit pricey but worth every penny.

Unprofessional & ridiculous behavior
I went to Popeyes chicken on E. Washington street in Indianapolis. I was ignored at the counter for approximately 4 minutes before being greeted by "yep". I ordered & it took almost 25 minutes to get my order. While I was waiting, I listened to the employees laughing, talking loudly, sharing phone pictures/videos, and cursing repeatedly. I am a professional Chef & I was completely appalled by the behavior of the employees. One of the contributors was the manager! Unacceptable!!!! I love Popeyes, but I will NOT go back to this particular store...Unprofessional & ridiculous...

Popeyes New Street Birmingham not worth it.
So Popeyes open in Birmingham UK on new street recently so i thought id go and have a see what it was like. Considering there's a KFC, Wing Stop, Nandos and GDK on the same strip id was expecting a decent meal, oh how i was mistaken.

Ordered a BBQ Louisiana box with two tenders and a coleslaw, and after a 15 min wait and the server forgetting to give me my cup for the drink i took it back to the office.

Ill start positive the tenders were very good, and thats that. Chips were chewy and almost cold, the burger was disappointing, whilst the chicken was good it was smothered in BBQ and Mayo on both sides which made it sickly, some one thought putting three slices of cucumber on it was a good idea, they were wrong, soggy and covered in sauce not pleasant to eat.

The picture of the coleslaw on the kiosk looked really good, what was in the pot was not. overly mayoed and I've had better from the pound shop. definitely not what it looked like in its picture.

Wont be going back as i paid £14.98 for a really lack lustre lunch and there's plenty of better places to go.

Popeyes in Torrevieja…
Tried the new Popeyes in Torrevieja next to Carrefour. Food was terrible. The chicken nuggets/pieces were awful, the fries were very few and disgusting. Their idea of salad was a lot of lettuce in a box with 2 thin slices of tomatoes on top covered in the crispy coating they must use for the chicken. The burger was very small too. We were given another box of lettuce with bits of cheese on top that we didn't even order. This disgusting meal cost just over 27 euros!! As for the staff......bad attitude and didn't really know what they were doing. Lesson learnt! Won't be going back ever!!

Popeyes in Williamsport..Upsetting!
Popeyes in Williamsport pa was absolutely terrible tonight with their customer service! Went through the drive through and ordered a wing combo meal and wasn’t even asked what drink I’d like but had a total.. Not sure why or when they thought it was okay to give me a total without asking what side or drink I’d like. Then after the food was gotten, a wing was outside of the container! Very disappointed!

Good food but the drive through service is terrible at 4815 Lebanon Pk, Hermitage TN. Their drive thru has two lanes but one lane is not getting handled. After I finally was served (after backing up and switching to the other drive thru lane) I paid my money and then waited 15 minutes because they didn't have any chicken. Seems like they don't have any managers.

“Tried to feed my children, didn't work.”
Colleen T. 6/15/24
I have tried many times to get in touch with someone here, you will not speak to any of your customers, you make them text you. This is ridiculous. I am also contacting the BBB for a refund. This is absurd the way you people act. You take almost $60.00 and won't even talk to me to try to make it right. I want my money back asap.

Tried Popeye's for the first and last time today. The Mac n cheese is disgusting...nothing like soggy overcooked noodles soaked with what is supposed to be cheese but is good knows what. The chicken tenders are borderline ok but seriously even at a measley13.00 I got ripped off.

Popeyes Montgomery AL
June 5th, 2024
The only reason Montgomery locations get a 1 is when you can get food it is good. I gone to my last Popeyes as the service is horrible and too much time to get this food. I have given the locations too many chances Went to two locations today to get a sandwich and neither could serve me a too back up Went to another chicken sandwich location and was in a out in minutes with a fresh hot sandwich and they were 3 times busier. Goodbye Popeyes.

Belleville Crossing) worst customer service ever!
May 18th, 2024
Omg! Omg! The Popeyes at Belleville Crossing has the worst customer service of all times. The entire staff needs to be fired. They all rude. From that girl name TT their managers on down is the worse. I swear this is absolutely the worst treatment you can receive. They all have bad attitudes they never speak They wait time is unbelievable long. I mean it's like a nightmare going in there. Pleeeaaase hire a new crew.

Upset
May 21st, 2024
I have ate at Popeyes for years and am very angry. I have always gotten a 2peice dinner with a breast and a wing. Today I was told I could only get a breast and thigh. I do not eat thighs. You have just lost a frequent customer. Also my husband ordered the same a few weeks ago for me at work and I got a leg and thigh instead. Horrible service in Columbus ms.

Customer Service
April 28th, 2024
I have been in Michigan 13 years now and never had a good experience with Popeyes. Customer service is ghetto and rude. They always get my order wrong, even after they call my order back to me. Something is always missing in my order. Not sure how any of these people were hired. Never seen anything like it in my life.

Tiny chicken
April 19th, 2024
Drumstick about the size of a wing, thigh not much bigger than a nugget. Never seen such small pieces before and I'm wondering where in the world you can buy it like these tiny "tots". At Marysville WA Popeyes Chicken.
Tip for consumers:
I think it was a rip off by Popeyes Xhicken

Food POISONING
April 10th, 2024
Went to Popeyes on Friday April 5,2024 and ordered the fish sandwich and ended up getting sick with food poisoning went to my PCP and it was food poisoning the worst thing that could happen to anyone. I guess you're never safe at restaurants like Popeyes or any other fast food joint. You take your life into your own hands. Stop serving the fish sandwich!

A score of 1 is being generous
April 12th, 2024
I very much like their spicy tenders and until recently visited twice weekly. The Orange City, Florida location has declined in quality of product and certainly service. The staff is rude, obviously hate their job, and the customers they serve. I visited today and before I paid asked if everything i ordered was available. I learned to ask because they are almost always out of something. Even though I was told they had everything, it wasn't. The clerk got very upset that I wanted to cancel my order. I just walked out.

Molded lemon pepper chicken wings
April 13th, 2024
I bought 3 boxes of 12 pieces wings both lemon pepper and sweet and sour. I kept seeing blue spot on the wings. My son ate almost 2 containers and vomited 3 times. When I looked closely at the spots they were MOLD. When I went back in the morning to get a refund she asked me for the molded food. I replied why to reserve it. She asked me to leave the store or get arrested. This is disgusting 🤢 she recommended that I leave instead of giving me a full refund. Now my son feels horrible and my belly was upset all night. Then my son googled molded chicken at Popeyes and there are actually several others who caught the Mold on camera before eating it all. Oh my goodness!

Don't try to contact Popeyes customer service
April 3rd, 2024
I had a Popeyes store that was great buy then they got a new manager and it was terrible I ordered chicken and got a chicken neck instead of a leg. No napkins, no diet sweetener for the tea. I tried to call Popeyes customer service but all I got was a text AI bot. Worthless and time consuming with no help. Looks like they no longer respect their customers so sad I liked their food. But I will be fine without it.

Wtf is this!? JUNK!
March 2nd, 2024
I don't understand all the raves I've heard about this chicken. Ate there for the first time and I ordered some tenders. They were absolutely tasteless. No herbs or spices, pieces were small and over cooked. Biscuits had more taste but unfortunately, it was salty tasting... a biscuit.
My daughter got the "signature" wings. Looked good but she almost chipped a tooth when she tried to bite into them. I could've taken chunks from the chicken and loaded them into my muzzle loader and used it as ammo. Just $#*!ty all the way around. Won't be ever eating there again. I'll stick with KFC!

Never Again
April 28th, 2022
I remember when Popeyes was good food and happy to get it. I sit in a Popeyes at this moment in Ft Worth Texas and have vowed to myself never again will I spend a dime at Popeyes. Ordered Cajun fish. Watered down lemonade unappetizing three pieces of fish that looked worse than gas station fried fish served in a plain container. As soon as I saw it, it screamed" I am not gonna be any good for you" wished I had listened and just walked away from it. Bad to no taste - think elementary school food on a bad day. Hard to understand cashier. Popeyes - you cannot go down in chicken grease flames soon enough. Last dollar you will ever get from me or my family I promise. Man, you stink. But really. I could eat better from my own trash can. Feel sad for what you have become. What happened to you?

Nottingham Popeye's is great.
I have been to the Nottingham Popeye's twice, the restaurant is clean and well decorated. The chicken is tasty and the service is great.

I was greeted warmly and politely. The manager took my order and made good suggestions. The food came quickly and was well presented. They came to check on me and that's why I'd recommend them.

I visited this restaurant for the first time, not too disappointing I will say but not the best, just an average 'American' restaurant. Majority of staff were friendly but one staff member in particular was rude and blunt. Very rude and inconsiderate. Popeyes, hire friendlier staff if you want customers to come back. Thankyou

The french fries were cold and tasted like they were cooked in the same oil as the chicken. Just had a bad after taste The worse french fries I have eaten in a long time. The pieces of some of the chicken or very dry I believe they' have been sitting out for a while.

Lovely,spicy chicken and great service. Not quite busy on a Friday and milkshakes tasted wonderful. I would recommend checking your timings when coming to popeyes. We came here at 16:00pm and was very quiet. Also would recommend the 5 chicken wings. They were spicy and delicious 😋.

All Good
We saw the Alicante Popeyes opposite the Carrefour when we visited last weekend. We decided to try it as we love fried chicken. Tasty food, quick service and clean. Only concern was they charge for the mayonnaise.

I'm a fast-food reporter who tried Popeyes' fried chicken for the first time, and it's my new favorite menu item

Erin McDowell/Insider
I've tried a lot of fast-food items in my day, from burgers at McDonald's and Burger King to every burrito at Taco Bell.
However, I've somehow never tried Popeyes' famous fried chicken.
I ordered a four-piece chicken combo and thought it was perfectly juicy and crispy.
As a person who tries and tests fast food for a living, I've tasted most menu items at the chains I have available to me.
I was excited to try Popeyes' fried chicken for the very first time. Erin McDowell/Insider
In fact, I've eaten pretty much every menu item at Popeyes in both my personal life and for work. However, I've surprisingly never tried the chain's signature fried chicken. 
Whenever I've ordered Popeyes in the past, I've opted for either the much-beloved chicken sandwich, the chain's chicken tenders, or even the popcorn shrimp. Somehow, the chain's fried chicken has never called my name — until now.
I decided to try out Popeyes' fried chicken to see if it would become my new go-to order and whether it measured up to other items I've ordered from the chain in the past.
A four-piece chicken combo, which comes with four pieces of fried chicken, a biscuit, a side of your choice, and a drink, came to $12.49.

The box of chicken was heavy — I was impressed with how much food I received for the price.
I ordered Cajun fries with my meal, in addition to a Diet Coke.
My box of fried chicken, Cajun fries, and a biscuit. Erin McDowell/Insider
I've ordered the chicken tender combo from Popeyes before, so I was familiar with how the box comes packed with fries. I had to dig a little into the box to reach the fried chicken, but when I did I noticed that the serving size was bigger than I expected.
The box was supposed to come with four pieces of fried chicken, but my meal actually came with an extra wing.

The extra piece was a pleasant surprise, but I was more excited to see how the fried chicken would actually taste.
The fried chicken was super crispy on the outside.

Large crystal-like clumps of fried batter coated the outside. It looked almost as if it had been dipped in cornflakes, it was so crunchy. The batter is apparently the same one used for the chain's chicken tenders, but the fried chicken appeared to be even crispier.
Inside, the meat was unbelievably moist and flavorful.

The fried outer shell had the perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness, with a buttery flavor that brought it all together. It was super crunchy without being greasy — a quality of perfect fried chicken. 
Out of every piece I tried, I liked the wings the least and the leg the most.

All of the pieces of chicken were fried the same amount, but some obviously had more meat than others. This isn't a criticism, just a fact.
The drumstick was my second favorite piece.

It was super juicy and had a ton of meat inside, despite being one of the smaller pieces.
By the time I got to the fried chicken thigh, I was stuffed — and I didn't even eat the whole pieces of chicken.

I thought that the bang for your buck at Popeyes was unbeatable. For less than $13, I could have easily split this meal with another person, or even two.
I thought this was an exceptional deal, especially considering a five-piece chicken tenders meal costs $14.99. I felt I got way more meat with the fried chicken than I ever did when I ordered chicken tenders.
The Cajun fries were well seasoned and perfectly fluffy.

They complemented the fried chicken well, but next time I might order coleslaw instead for a fresher flavor and more acidity to offset the rich fried chicken.
Overall, I was highly impressed by the fried chicken from Popeyes. I would definitely order it again.

In fact, after trying almost every item on the Popeyes menu at this point, the fried chicken might just be my favorite. It was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and the amount of food I received was amazing for the price.
Although the chicken sandwich will always have a place in my heart, I liked the fried chicken better. I also thought it beat the chicken tenders in terms of bang for your buck.
It might have been my first time eating Popeyes' fried chicken, but it definitely won't be my last.

Every Popeyes Menu Item, Ranked Worst To Best
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
BY KRISTINA MANENTEUPDATED: SEPT. 8, 2023 11:48 AM EST
Once called Chicken on the Run, what we know today as Popeyes was opened in 1972 by Alvin C. Copeland Sr., serving up spicy New Orleans-style spicy fried chicken. By 1985 he would be opening his 500th restaurant in Landover, Maryland, a far ways a way from Louisiana. He went through a few name changes, from Popeyes Mighty Good Fried Chicken to Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, (with other names sprinkles in there, too) before settling on Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. However, what remained constant was the crispy fried chicken. 
The recipes for Popeyes' signature chicken and other offerings are so important and vital to the success of the restaurant, that after Copeland died, they had to buy them from his family. For a whopping 43 million dollars. That's some expensive chicken. It's served them well, however. Popeyes has never been more popular, and with lines out the door for their chicken sandwich, you know their food is good.
But what's the best food from Popeyes? Not everything they're serving up is as good as the next menu item — in fact, there are quite a few items you should probably just skip. This is our ranking of Popeyes food, from worst to best.
16. Popeyes Red Beans and Rice
Facebook
Red beans and rice is a defining dish of New Orleans. They love their kidney beans. One of the first real recipes on how to make kidney beans appeared in The Picayune's Creole Cook Book that came about at the turn of the 19th century. So it makes sense for Popeyes to have a red bean and rice dish. But just because they have it, doesn't mean it's good.
When even the restaurant's description for this side is more or less just the name of the dish, you know it's not going to be very exciting. Sure, Popeyes Red Beans and Rice is unique when it comes to fast food sides, but there's nothing to write home about here. The rice is seasoned, like mostly everything at Popeyes is, and then is mixed with red beans that have a smokey flavor. Cool? The smokey flavor comes from liquid smoke, not actual slow cooking, and the rice is always cooked well, but it's just rice — nothing special.
15. Popeyes Cajun Rice
Facebook
Maybe rice shouldn't be a fast food thing. Especially when it comes off as more of a novelty menu item than anything else. Dirty rice, which is what Popeyes' Cajun Rice emulates, is a dish with a deep, rich, yet also dark history in Louisiana. Typically made from the discarded organ meats of the chicken and rice, dirty rice was a slave dish that was both filling and tasted good, but still paled to what was being served in the main house of plantations. Still, over decades it became more of a staple dish for the poor, and is now considered one of Louisiana's most authentic dishes.
And then there's Popeyes' version. The chain relies on its Cajun spices and flavor to carry their version of dirty rice, but it falls short of the real thing. The rice is fine, but it's not that flavorful on its own. It does contain some meat in its Cajun meat sauce, including ground chicken gizzards, but a lot of it is preservatives. If you want dirty rice, treat it right and make it yourself.
14. Popeyes Mashed Potatoes with Gravy
Facebook
The only thing worth eating in this side dish from Popeyes is the Cajun Gravy. That stuff is tasty. The mashed potatoes, however, are meh at best. They're mashed potatoes. There's nothing about them that makes them stand out or be memorable at all (unlike what they serve at another chicken place). That gravy however, we wish Popeyes would bottle it separate and sell. Alas, asking for extra gravy often results in not so great customer experiences, making us more apt to suffer through our gravy-less potatoes. Some people feel the gravy is a bit too oily for their taste, but it all comes down to gravy preferences.
The gravy is made with smoked pork, as well as ground beef, bell peppers, and turkey. Meanwhile the mashed potatoes are heavy on the butter and milk, but they also contain shortening, which can give them an odd sort of texture. You can get better mashed potatoes elsewhere, is what we're saying.
13. Popeyes Coleslaw
Facebook
If you're going to Popeyes to get your greens, you're doing it wrong. That said, coleslaw is delicious and can be quite refreshing when you need to cut through all the fried goodness. Popeyes bills their coleslaw as a "cool, crisp, and tangy treat," and while it isn't bad, we must admit it's a touch lacking when it comes to the realm of coleslaw. 
There is some uniqueness to the typical cabbage and carrots meets mayonnaise when it comes to the coleslaw at Popeyes however. The addition of pickles sets it apart and does add a nice tang to each bite. The lemon juice enhances that, while the small addition of paprika and turmeric gives it some color and a touch more flavor.
We don't hate the coleslaw from Popeyes... but we do know that we can get a much better bowl of this crisp and refreshing side dish if we head down the road to KFC. And for that reason, it's pretty far to the bottom of this list.
12. Popeyes Green Beans
Facebook
Ok, hear us out. We know what you're thinking. Who goes to Popeyes and gets green beans? Smart people do. Because these green beans with turkey bacon are delicious. They're easily the best side offered at Popeyes, bar the biscuits. With a creamy gravy mixed in, and added bacon, this is definitely one of the most nutritious items on the menu. While you're unlikely to go to Popeyes to be healthy, it's at least good to know it's an option, right? While there's nothing astounding happening with Popeyes' green beans, if you like the vegetable, you're probably going to enjoy this version.
The green beans and (that tasty gravy they're swimming in) do contain pork, chicken, and turkey, so that smokey meaty flavor you get from these beans isn't fake. That said, this definitley isn't a vegetarian dish — just in case the chunks of bacon didn't give that away. 
11. Popeyes Cinnamon Apple Pie
Facebook
Popeyes is no stranger to desserts. They have a rotating stock based on seasons, holidays, and what-have-you. From banana pudding parfait to Mardi Gras cheesecake, each of these offerings has had its highs and lows. That said, the reigning king of Popeyes desserts is easily the cinnamon apple pie. It has all the best parts of apple pie in a perfect pocket. The crust is warm and crispy and doused in cinnamon sugar, while the inside is a not-to-sweet apple filling with even more cinnamon. It's a cinnamon explosion that is perfectly satisfying, especially on a cool day.
If you're not a cinnamon fan, chances are you probably won't be thrilled with Popeyes version of the quintessential American dessert. There are a lot of fast food apple pies out there, and everyone has a different opinion on the best one. But if you trust us, it's this one.
10. Popeyes Biscuits
Instagram
Many people will say that you cannot go to Popeyes and not get a biscuit. It's kind of the law. First introduced in 1983, the buttermilk biscuits have become a staple of the Popeyes menu ever since. They're buttery, flaky and crumbly, soft and delicate, and can fit into your mouth in one go if you're really dedicated to it. Some people eat them plain, others make a chicken sandwich with them, while others wait until they're drenched with gravy, red beans, and whatever other sides they have on hand.
People love these biscuits so much there are hundreds of copycat recipes online, but why bother when they actually came out with a mix for you to make them at home? How nice of them. Sometimes Popeyes even has fun with their biscuits, like making them heart-shaped for National Buttermilk Biscuit Day. Yes, that's a real thing. Biscuits are important, people.
9. Popeyes Blackened Tenders
Instagram
You may not immediately realize these are available on the menu, as the default for Popeyes tenders is the fried version, but you can ask for your three-, five-, or 10-piece tenders to come as blackened. Typically associated with Cajun cooking, blackened chicken (or any meat really) basically means that it's cooked to replicate the taste of a charcoal grill without actually being cooked on charcoal. The trick is in the seasoning and technique.
Popeyes' Blackened Tenders are particularly popular with the Keto crowd. What makes them ketogenic friendly (and generally low-carb) is that the chicken is tossed in Popeyes Cajun seasoning and then fried without any of the breading. This mimics the traditional blackening technique of covered meat in spices and then cooking on a hot pan. Popeyes just substitutes its fryer for the skillet, meaning it makes for a relatively healthy meal at a fast food chain. That is, if you skip the sauce. If you're not doing keto and just want some nice smokey delicious chicken tenders, you'll love these as well!
8. Popeyes Boneless Wings
Instagram
You may be thinking this is heresy, eating boneless wings, but wait until you've popped a few of these bad boys in your mouth until you complain. Not quite a nugget, but not quite an actual wing, Popeyes boneless wings are delicious, crispy morsels of breast meat perfect for sauce dipping and snacking. Popeyes Boneless Wings came about after the 2017 chicken wing shortage, and were originally a limited edition deal, but have been back a few times since then and as of November 2019, they're a permanent menu item. Since then they've had multiple iterations from smokehouse, to honey mustard, and Cajun sparkle. Sometimes they even come with tater tots. Tater tots!
What makes these boneless bites so good is that they're just as juicy and crispy as the tenders and signature chicken, but they're bite-sized and are prime for dipping. Popeyes' range of sauces, including BBQ, hot and spicy, honey mustard, smokey ranch, and more.
7. Popeyes Cajun Fries
Instagram
You know how when you go to fast food place and order a meal, the fries are just the side you order because, well, that's what they have? Popeyes has a wide selection of sides, but we'd still choose their fries any day of the week. Move over boring old fried potatoes, there's something better out in Louisiana. 
Popeyes' Cajun Fries are a must with any meal from the fast food giant. Made with their special seasoning, these fries are as flavorful as they are spicy. It just adds more pizzazz to your meal, while also being an entirely respectable snack on its own. Sometimes Popeyes' Cajun Fries get a bit of a makeover as well, like the time they were loaded up with cheddar cheese, bacon, and gravy.
One drawback is that they lose their crisp awfully fast. If you don't made slightly soggy fries, then no harm, no foul, but most of us get a bit bummed when our crispy fried potatoes are no longer crispy.
6. Popeyes Mild Chicken Tenders
YouTube
Chicken tenders aren't just for kids you know. These all-white breast meat strips of chickeny goodness are crispy and delightful for all ages. The tenders get their own special seasoning, meaning they have a slightly different flavor profile from the signature chicken's blend. These are the mild version, however, so don't worry if you can't pack on the spice. There's another chicken tender for that.
This may catch you off guard, but the regular chicken tenders are actually the lowest in fat of Popeyes fried chicken offerings. At only about 148 calories per strip, that's not too shabby. Well, for fast food anyhow. Throughout the years there have been many iterations of the chicken tenders, including a version fried in waffle batter. 
One of the best parts of eating tenders is dipping them in sauce. The options at Popeyes are plentiful, what with six Signature Sauces including: Bayou Buffalo, Barbeque, Sweet Heat, Mardi Gras Mustard, Buttermilk Ranch, and Blackened Ranch. So many sauces, so little time.
5. Popeyes Handcrafted Spicy Tenders
YouTube
If you're a chicken tender lover, but still want that New Orleans-style spice, never fear, the Handcrafted Spicy Tenders are here. These also get their own special seasoning, including some cayenne to pack in the heat. It's that extra layer of spice that makes the spicy tenders just a bit better than the original chicken tenders. After all, most people come to Popeyes for the flavorful chicken. Treat yourself. 
If they end up being a touch too spicy, you can always cool your mouth down with one of the many dipping sauces that Popeyes has. The ones that pair best with the spicy tenders would be Buttermilk Ranch and Blackened Ranch, if you want a bit of smoke in there as well. Like the mild chicken tenders, the spicy version has had a few cousins on the menu here and there. This includes the Hot Honey Crunch Chicken Tenders.
4. Popeyes Voodoo Tenders
Instagram
Popeyes comes out with limited edition offerings all the time, but most of them pass on without any real fan base. These Voodoo Chicken Tenders though? We would fight for these. Not only do you get three or five of Popeyes delicious chicken tenders with each order, but they pack a major flavor punch with their drizzling of ghost pepper, garlic, fried green onions. Add in that Voodoo Sauce and it's spicy, sweet, and salty is everything you need in your mouth (and life). 
They're not for everyone,though. Ghost peppers are typically over 1 million on the Scoville scale for spiciness (that's up to 400 times hotter than a jalapeno by the way), and while you won't be biting right into one, these tenders do pack a punch. The sweetness of the sugar and pineapple in the sauce balances it out though, so don't be afraid to try these if you haven't yet (and if they're still available).
3. Popeyes Popcorn Shrimp
Instagram
You may not think of getting a seafood dish at a place known for their fried chicken above all else. However, you'd be making a mistake. Popeyes does seafood well. Especially when it comes to their shrimp items. The popcorn shrimp are tender, juicy, and perfectly spiced while also have that trademark crunch when you bite into them. Popeyes' Butterfly Shrimp are incredible, but sadly they're a limited edition summer item that really needs to be on the regular menu all year round. Please, Popeyes?
A big drawback is that you can't get the popcorn shrimp a la carte anymore. When they first came out you could buy them separately. However, these days they're only available in a meal deal. However, if you've got someone who wants your sides while you inhale these delicious morsels, you've got a great deal. Also, sometimes the popcorn shrimp come in fun shapes.
2. Popeyes Signature Chicken
Instagram
Ah, the classic. The chicken that started it all. Popeyes Signature Chicken is great. There's just something about the smell of the spices and grease that gets the blood flowing and the stomach growling, isn't there? Ever since the "Love That Chicken" tagline originated in 1980, people have been singing the praises of Popeyes Signature Chicken. Regardless of whether you're a wing person, a breast person, or a drumstick person, you'll love the crunch of their famous batter. Popeyes marinates their chicken for 12 hours, which is rather noteworthy for a fast food chain. It just goes to show that they don't skimp on quality here. The result is that the chicken is juicy and moist. No dry fried chicken to be found here!
Popeyes also requires that anyone who supplies chicken to them adhere to the animal guidelines from the National Chicken Council. As the company isn't directly involved in raising the chickens they use, they do regular audits of their suppliers and their methods.
1. Popeyes Chicken Sandwich
Facebook
Could it have been anything else? There's a reason Popeye's Chicken Sandwich sold out nationwide for months. There's a reason outlets have gone nuts over its announced return. It's amazing. People have even been killed over it. Originally, Popeye's produced and budgeted enough chicken sandwiches to last through the end of September from its August 12 release, but it went through them twice as fast because everyone wanted a bite. There's plenty of opinions about where the Popeye's chicken sandwich ranks among its competitors, most notoriously against Chick-fil-A's. One bite and there's really no question. Popeye's reigns supreme. It's just that good, people.
Perfectly fried and with crisp buttermilk batter, it's hugged between two buttery brioche buns and the just right amount of mayonnaise and pickles. The spicy version has cayenne thrown into the mix as well. While the original  release of the sandwich caused a social media meltdown over a rush to get it, some customers believe the second release isn't as good, nor as large in size, as the first. Having sampled many since it's return, we can't say that we agree. It's just as good as the first time around. In fact, we'll probably eat even more.

Look, it's fast food. I've only been to the drive thru. There's not much to say about the ambiance. It's a Popeyes. But compared to Church's or KFC? It's just so much better. And their wings are legit as good as or better than fried wings at any sports bar.
Generally the folks at the drive thru are nice and it doesn't take too long to get through the line.
So why am I writing this? Because I think everyone needs to know that the wings are not typical fast food wings. You could serve them at your Super Bowl party and no one would know.

Popeyes fell short of expectations. I ordered the 5 piece tender combo with cajun fries, a frozen mango lemonade, a cinnamon apple pie, and a biscuit through Uber Eats. While the meal arrived on time and was properly packaged, the food quality was disappointing.

The chicken tenders were a mix between hard, dry and under cooked. The biscuits one was doughy and the other dry. The fries were cold and limp. The lemonade had a hint of mango taste and mostly watery. The only redeeming quality was the apple pie filling, but even that was overshadowed by an overly dusted cinnamon and sugar-fried dough.
Overall, it was a disappointing experience.

Order
5 Pc Tender Combo with Cajun Fries $14.99
Frozen Mango Lemonade (upcharge $0.88)
Cinnamon Apple Pie - $2.36
1 Biscuit - $1.61

Food is great. But Service is always meh. Always Slow. I ate in to make sure my order was right. Homeless folk in the dining area made it a little uncomfortable however. The sandwich was good but I wish I had gotten the chicken even though it's kinda expensive.

Just went to the Popeys at 2554 Kingsland Blvd, Katy TX 77492 #11383.
The service was really bad. The person that took my order was the manager and she could not speak or understand English. All the people inside spoke spanish.
I would ask her the price of something and she would just repeat what I said. Several times she just keep repeating what I said to her. She finally got someone over that could speak some english and he told me what the price was. If you are going to have these popeys you should have someone to beable to speak and understand English. Bad Service over all....

The wings are ordered online. When I arrived they were soft not Krispy at all. Like soft chicken for smothering. I informed the counter staff and she replied it would be 5 mins. I waited about 8 minutes to only see the cook take the old chicken in the pan from the light warmer take it to the fryer area pick it up no gloves to re-drop that same soft chicken. I asked for a refund they stated I needed to call the number on the receipt are because not placed at the store--. The bottom line still trying to sell old chicken.. Health dept please visit here

The service is horrible. The management is so rude, every other fast food place in this area has Great customer service. They talk about people in Spanish. I would not go here if you don't want your day to be upsetting by a business who is franchise. I have called corporate and they can't reach him. The owner does not care at all.The Manager fired all the blacks and yall wonder why all the Mexican are taking over employment. They become rude managers and hire only Mexican.

This is the second time I've gotten garlic parmesan flavored wings from the Tomball location, that were made with spicy chicken wings. There won't be a third time. I don't want spicy chicken wings, I want garlic parmesan wings! Why is it that they use spicy chicken for something that isn't supposed to be spicy? I like Popeye's chicken, but I do not like spicy foods as I get really bad heartburn from it. Another issue that I have is that they seem to consistently under-cook the chicken. The meat should not still be pinkish and rubbery after cooking. Salmonella anyone? I will just start going to the Pinehurst Popeye's as I have never had an issue with that location.

When Popeyes launched its chicken sandwich in early August, nobody expected it to go this far.






Popeyes and Chick-fil-A engaged in a Twitter battle last week over which chain's chicken sandwich was superior, following the rollout of Popeyes' new chicken sandwich.
The social media feud went viral, fueling unprecedented orders at Popeyes locations and a shortage of the menu item at many locations nationwide.
Many employees at Popeyes are working extra hours - some over 60 a week - to handle the demand. One employee said he was "working like a slave in the back" to fill sandwich orders during an 11-hour shift on Saturday.
Five Popeyes employees who spoke with Business Insider described long hours, massive crowds, and threats from hungry, angry customers.
"Popeyes restaurants experienced unprecedented volumes over the last couple of weeks. All restaurant employees have worked very hard. We are very grateful for all that they do for Popeyes guests," a Popeyes representative said in a statement to Business Insider.

When Popeyes launched its chicken sandwich in early August, nobody expected it to go this far.

Following the rollout of the new menu item, Popeyes and Chick-fil-A engaged in a battle via Twitter over which chain had the better sandwich. Even Wendy's got in on the action, but stalwart defenders of Popeyes rose to defend the sandwich that was crowned number one by Business Insider's fast-food critic, Irene Jiang, in a chicken sandwich head-to-head.

The Twitter feud and ensuing hype prompted a massive uptick in chicken sandwich orders at Popeyes, causing a shortage of the item at many locations.

For Popeyes and Chick-fil-A, the chicken sandwich war still rages on. And at the frontlines of the battle are the employees - managers, sandwich makers, shift leaders, and cashiers - some of whom are working more than 60-hour weeks and many days without breaks in order to quell the public's craving for chicken sandwiches.

Business Insider spoke with five Popeyes employees across the US about working at the chain during the so-called "chicken wars." Workers say that they are overwhelmed and exhausted, and many are considering quitting their jobs.

"I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo," said Carlos an 18-year-old Popeyes crew member in Orange County, California.

This employee and other Popeyes' workers have been granted anonymity in order to allow them to speak frankly about working conditions and the situation more generally at Popeyes. Employees told Business Insider that when the chicken sandwich was rolled out, the response was almost immediate and overwhelming.

"Popeyes restaurants experienced unprecedented volumes over the last couple of weeks. All restaurant employees have worked very hard. We are very grateful for all that they do for Popeyes guests," a Popeyes representative said in a statement to Business Insider.

'Everyone wanted to quit'

A Popeyes employeea nd other employees told Business Insider that when the chicken sandwich was rolled out, the response was almost immediate and overwhelming.

"Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad," he said. "We have never seen it get this insanely busy."

A Popeyes employee said his location sold out of the chicken sandwich at around 6 p.m. the first day. The next day, it was sold out by mid-day.


A Popeyes employee added: "My experience at Popeyes has been fine till this sandwich has come."

One now-former Popeyes employee who worked at a Newark, New Jersey, location told Business Insider that she actually did quit last Wednesday "in the middle of making two sandwiches." Crowds had been building at her location as the viral debate over who had the superior chicken sandwich raged.

"The issue with Popeyes or any fast food is the treatment and the amount of pay that a worker gets," the now-former employee said.

"The added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing," she added.

A part-time employee in a West Coast Popeyes said she and her coworkers usually don't take breaks until a minimum of four to five hours into their shifts.

"My coworkers said that there's been nights that they go home at 2 am when closing is at 11," the employee added. A high school senior, the employee said that her shifts have generally been bearable, though she has considered quitting if the store remains as busy at it has recently been.



Popeyes workers say the situation is getting dangerous in some locations
Irene Jiang / Business Insider

In some cases, the work environment at Popeyes has become dangerous.

"I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out," a manager at an East Coast Popeyes said.

She said that the lines at her location were like nothing she had ever experienced at work.

"You would think at the Popeyes I work in that there was a concert going on," she added.

"I had an instance where a customer was threatening to assault me when I was taking out trash," another employee said. "A customer sees me and shouts, 'Do we have a problem or what! Why no sandwiches! You guys are third Popeyes to say so! You better stop looking at me or else!' I was looking at the line."

The employee added that it is not uncommon for workers to go entire shifts without taking a break, saying that one coworker worked 65 hours over six days. This employee said their restaurant has shifted to mostly focusing on completing orders, neglecting certain tasks like sweeping and washing dishes for the time being. According to the Popeyes employee, many workers are looking for new jobs.

"It's pretty stressful," the employee said.



Popeyes' CEO says it has been a 'tough week' for workers
Irene Jiang / Business Insider

For many employees, the sudden overwhelming response to the new menu item was strange, considering the chicken sandwich had already been served in many locations for about a year.

In fact, when Business Insider went to taste test chicken sandwiches early in August, before the new sandwich had been officially announced, a Manhattan location was already serving it.

Now, getting a chicken sandwich is much more difficult. Reports of chicken sandwich shortages continued on Tuesday, sparking concerns that it might be a more long-term problem.

When Business Insider spoke with Jose Cil, the CEO of Popeyes' parent company Restaurant Brands International, last Friday, he acknowledged that it had been a "tough week" for many workers in stores.

"They've worked really hard, and actually the success that we've seen with the launch of the chicken sandwich is really a success that's been driven by our franchise partners as well as our team members and the restaurants," he said.

The Truth About Working At Popeyes Revealed By Workers
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
BY JOEL STICEUPDATED: JAN. 28, 2020 4:52 PM EST
The Popeyes chicken sandwich became one of the biggest food stories of 2019. 
This Louisiana-based chicken chain was a fast food staple long before they challenged Chick-fil-A's sandwich throne, though. In 1972, Alvin Copeland began serving his Cajun-flavored chicken in a New Orleans suburb and four years later he opened the first Popeyes restaurant.
There's no telling how many people Popeyes has employed in its 2,700 plus restaurants over the decades, but the brand has never been more popular. All the buzz around Popeyes' chicken sandwich has also resulted in the spotlight being directed on the the employees who keep Popeyes afloat and serve that delicious sandwich. 
Working in fast food can be tough work, and Popeyes employees are on their feet for hours at a time while they work to serve a hungry and sometimes impatient public. Often for only minimum wage or a few bucks more. 
The employees of this popular chicken chain have recently witnessed customer fights, and themselves been the target of threats from customers. It's not all chicken chaos though. The job does provide a stepping stone to customer service, and some restaurant employees have even found themselves climbing the corporate ranks. 
Straight from the employees of Popeyes, here's what it's like to work for one of the biggest names in fast food chicken.
The shifts can be grueling for Popeyes workers
YouTube
It's pretty much a given that if you work in the fast food business, you're going to be on your feet a lot. An employee of Popeyes could expect the occasional crowds of people during the lunch or dinner rush, but the introduction of the chicken sandwich only amplified that. 
The chicken sandwich has been nothing short of exhausting for the employees of Popeyes, and getting a break is almost unheard of. Popeyes' manager Wanda Lavender told Vox that she reportedly stands for 10 to 12 hours a day and that her "legs are still numb" from the work and "haven't recovered."
Lavender's experience is hardly the exception, and according to Business Insider, some Popeyes employees were pulling 60 hour weeks to meet the public's chicken sandwich demands. "I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo,"  an anonymous Popeyes employee said. 
Even before the chicken sandwich craze, work at Popeyes was no walk in the park. A high school employee on Reddit said that they would work until 1 a.m. before getting up at the crack of dawn for school. 
Obviously, comfortable shoes are a must with this job.
The pay for Popeyes workers isn't very good
YouTube
The low pay for fast food employees has been a hot topic of debate for years, and Popeyes isn't an exception when it comes to the wages its employees earn. According to Indeed, the average hourly wage for a Popeyes crew member is about $9.50 an hour. That may be a little more than two bucks extra than the United States federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but many employees still feel it's hardly equal to the work of the job. 
Fran Marion, a Popeyes employee in Kansas City, Missouri who is a single mother of two children told The Guardian that despite working six days a week and a second job, she struggles to provide for her family. "It makes me feel like a peasant," Marion said. "In a way it's slavery. It's economic slavery." 
Popeyes managers do earn a little more at an average of $12.93 an hour, but even working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, that's not even an annual salary of $26,000. 
According to Popeyes' website, the company does off certain benefits such as education assistance, a 401(k), and "cash awards on your employment anniversary." Who knows how many of Popeyes' fast food employees are actually getting these benefits, and despite the company having a score of 2.8 out of five on Indeed in the pay category, it has an overall score of 3.5 stars out of five.
The customers at Popeyes can sometimes be hostile to employees
YouTube
Anybody who has ever worked in fast food will tell you that it can be a very tiring job. Aside from the long hours and low pay, employees also have to deal with their fair share of rude customers. "Two times people threw drinks back at me when I worked drive-thru," one former Popeyes employee said on Reddit. 
Rude customers are nothing new in fast food, and the demand for Popeyes' chicken sandwich has brought with it numerous incidents of hostile customer behavior. When the chicken sandwich first rolled out in August of 2018, Popeyes manager Wanda Lavender said one disgruntled customer threatened to shoot the staff over the sandwich. "It was out of control," Lavender said. 
"I had an instance where a customer was threatening to assault me when I was taking out trash," another employee said. 
Similar incidents have happened at other locations too. Police in Houston responded to a call that a drive-thru customer brandished a gun when they were told there were no more sandwiches (via The Guardian). 
The sandwich was briefly taken off the menu when Popeyes couldn't keep up with demand, but when it came back the rude customers returned along with it. A man in Harlem, New York was captured on video berating employees because they weren't making the sandwiches quick enough. 
Working with the public isn't always easy, but at Popeyes, it can be downright dangerous.
It's not unusual for employees to abruptly quit Popeyes

With the long hours, low pay, and occasionally rude customer, it doesn't come as a surprise that some Popeyes employees quit on the spot. People can only be pushed so far in a job before they reach the breaking point, and the chicken sandwich madness has ushered in that breaking point for numerous Popeyes employees. 
"Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad," one Popeyes crew member in Orange County, California told Business Insider.  "We have never seen it get this insanely busy." Another employee at a New Jersey restaurant said that she abruptly quit right in the middle of putting together two sandwiches for customers. 
Manager Wanda Lavender told Vox that she too has had employees quit on the spot because the job just became too stressful to handle. "It was too much," Lavendar said before adding "It's overwhelming."
While some Popeyes employees may decide to take their chances and look for another job, quitting isn't an option for others such as Lavender, who has six children to care for. "I'm not doing this just for kicks."
Getting hired at Popeyes isn't too difficult
Twitter
If you're in need of a job and have a Popeyes restaurant not too far away, they might be viable place to put in an application. Considering the hectic pace of the job, is it really all that surprising that Popeyes doesn't require potential employees to jump through too many hoops? 
Popeyes general manager Jordan Suriano says that if you can get an interview, then you'll likely get the job. Just as long as you don't come in smelling like a pot dispensary. "It happens fairly often," Suriano said before adding, "If you don't get a call back after submitting an application call to check up on the status of your application and let them know you are still interested."
A Popeyes employee on Indeed seemed to back up Suriano's tip and said that after applying online and having an interview, they called back and got hired over the phone. 
Now when it comes to getting a job in the Popeyes corporate offices, that can be a little trickier according to Garrison Xian, who spent a summer interning at Popeyes. "For the corporate office it has become a very competitive process as now applicants have to apply to Restaurant Brand International," Xian said." It is a very long process with three rounds of interviews and a 'superday.'"
Getting fired from Popeyes is pretty easy too
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
The fast food industry has a high turnover rate — like, ridiculously high. 
According to CNBC, turnover in the restaurant industry is around 130 percent a year, largely because fast food jobs aren't particularly desirable for many of the reasons outlined above. But not all of those workers are quitting.
Always showing up late or simply not doing the required work will get a person fired in any job, but Popeyes employees have been fired for a whole range of reasons. In 2015, a Popeyes worker claimed they were fired after refusing to pay back money that was stolen during an armed robbery. In August 2019, Popeyes canned employees for putting too much cayenne pepper in the store's chicken sandwiches. 
Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising example of Popeyes employees getting the ax came from a former restaurant manager on Reddit. According to the manager, several months after the Popeyes restaurant opened, a regional supervisor told him "Tomorrow an RV will be parked in the parking lot when you arrive. Send each employee out to take a polygraph before they clock in. Tell them, 'We're not looking for food theft. If you gave away food or ate food without paying for it just admit it so you don't get tagged as deceptive. We're looking for somebody who stole money.'"
The Popeyes manager said they suspected a real polygraph wasn't used, but regardless, half the store's employees were fired because of the ruse.
You get free food if you work at Popeyes, but might start to dislike fried chicken
Facebook
Popeyes is famous for their fried chicken and one perk of the job is that employees may get a free meal of that chicken while on their shift. 
"If the manager is chill enough they might let you have a 5-minute break and eat whatever you want," one employee said on Quora. While some employees on Glassdoor backed up this claim, others contradicted it and said they were only given a discount on select items while working their shift. "I feel like it should be better than what it is if you work over eight hours you should get a free meal," one employee said. 
Even if employees are getting some free food, that free fried chicken can get old pretty quick when the smell follows you home. If you're knee-deep in fried chicken for hours at a time, that smell is going to stick to you and it won't be long before your car starts to smell like the Popeyes kitchen. 
"Oh my god, you would not believe the amount of air fresheners I go through just to try and keep the smell of chicken sweat and my bad life decisions away," confessed one employee on Reddit.
Some employees feel that Popeyes is taking advantage of them
Twitter
According to Forbes, when Popeyes chicken sandwich returned in November of 2019, Popeyes' traffic was 300 percent above normal and even higher than when the sandwich initially launched. What's good for Popeyes as a whole, however, hasn't necessarily trickled down to the employees making the sandwich. 
"The corporation made all this money — millions — off of these sandwiches, but where's our cut? Where is our appreciation? Where is our thank-you? We made 5,000 sandwiches just in Wisconsin and sold every single one of them," Popeyes employee Wanda Lavender said.  
Fran Marion, who was working at Popeyes before the chicken sandwich came along, grosses around $950 for Popeyes taking orders in a seven-hour shift, but only takes home $76 (via The Guardian). Marion feels that Popeyes should pay its crew members a higher wage. "It's united we stand or divided we fall," Marion said. 
When asked by Business Insider about the overworked fast food employees, Popeyes CEO Jose Cil said it was a "tough week" for crew members around the country and said the sandwich's success was "driven by our franchise partners as well as our team members."
While that may be a verbal pat on the back, Popeyes workers would likely prefer a monetary one. "The added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing," confessed one employee.
Mardi Gras is the busiest time for Popeyes employees
Eric Baradat/Getty Images
The slam of the chicken sandwich will end eventually — at least that's what Popeyes employees are undoubtedly hoping for. After that, it'll be back to business as usual. That doesn't mean that Popeyes doesn't experience busy times of the season, though. The same way that Long John Silvers gets busy around Lent, Popeyes locations in the New Orleans area gets slammed with customers every February when Mardi Gras rolls around. 
It's not unusual for Popeyes locations to serve as much as 40 tons of red beans and rice, 1.5 million pieces of chicken, and over a million biscuits throughout the 12 day Mardi Gras celebration (via QSR). To keep up with that demand, the restaurants must hire extra staff and extend their normal business hours to nearly 24 hours a day in order to meet customers' needs as they head to and from various Mardi Gras events.  
"Mardi Gras is one of our biggest times of the year," vice president of operations, Dwayne Fontenette told Nola. "We open up at five o'clock in the morning... just to get ready for the parades."
Had Popeyes rolled out its chicken sandwich during Mardi Gras, well, it may have simply been too much for the staff to handle.
Some Popeyes employees enjoy the job
YouTube
Despite the long hours, lower wages, and potentially hostile customers, a lot of Popeyes workers take great pride in their work and some enjoy the job. One Popeyes employee on Quora said that they enjoyed numerous aspects of the job, from the crew member camaraderie to the customer interactions, fast pace of the work, and even the cleaning once the store was shut down. 
"Even though it's not a professional job, it is quite interesting to work at a Popeyes," the employee said, adding "Especially since it's my first job."
Other Popeyes employees expressed a similar satisfaction with the job and said that it provided them with a chance to serve people in their community. "Great opportunity to get a chance to work with the general working population and gain pointers on customer service," former employee Denise Davis said. 
While a lot of employees on Indeed did say that the work could be tiring for their small paycheck, numerous employees agreed that their coworkers made all the difference. "My coworkers where my biggest joy throughout my time at Popeyes, one employee said. "We created a bond like family and looked out for one another day after day."
Working at Popeyes may not be the perfect job, but it can certainly be a decent place to start if you need a steady paycheck and want some customer service experience.
If you can stick it out at Popeyes, there's the opportunity to grow
Eric Baradat/Getty Images
Working at Popeyes for the long haul obviously isn't going to be the right path for every employee, but for those who can hang in, there is an opportunity to move up through the ranks of the organization. 
While one employee on Indeed said that numerous changes in management did impact the morale of some employees, they said that they "worked hard and moved up quickly." Other employees voiced similar opinions, but noted that climbing the ladder gets more difficult after being moved up to the role of assistant manager. 
To be fair, climbing to the top of any organization is almost always going to be difficult, but as vice president of operations, Dwayne Fontenette proves — it can be done. "A lot of our employees start out as hourly employees and move up to management," Fontenette said. "Like myself, I moved up to the vice president of operations and I started out at the Popeyes on Read Boulevard in August of '84... first job out of high school." 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna call the shots at Popeyes.

Popeyes ownership responds after viral videos expose filth at Detroit store

DETROIT (WJBK) - A Popeye's worker exposed filthy conditions at an east side location in Detroit by posting videos online. 
Cell phone video of roaches, maggots and unsanitary conditions prompted the Detroit Health Department to pay a visit to the store on Gratiot and Seven Mile.
The video was recorded by an employee who claims to have brought these conditions to the attention of management but felt ignored, so she posted it online and it went viral.
FOX 2 saw an exterminator and several Popeyes employees inside the closed restaurant Tuesday. Detroit police were also at the scene to keep the onlookers moving. 
A cleaning crew remained on scene most of the afternoon, while Popeyes media relations released this statement:
"Food safety and quality is always a top priority for the Popeyes brand. The Franchisee who owns and operates this location has worked with local health officials to ensure that the restaurant is thoroughly sanitized and safe. At this time, the restaurant is fully operational after passing all health inspections."
Despite the statement from ownership, cones were placed in the parking lot and the doors were locked at least for the night. 
"You've got to shut the store down, get the news out here and everything just to get it cleaned up," said Janel McCloud. "That's not right."
McCloud works at a different Popeyes in Detroit but eats at this location from time to time. Last week she saw first-hand just some of what was recorded on video. 
"What I saw was roaches," McCloud said. "When I went to the restroom to wash my hands before I ate and stuff like that. I saw roaches and I saw them when I was ordering."
And she says this isn't the first time the bugs have been spotted inside. 
"It has been like this for a while," McCloud said. "Because my little sister used to work here and she said they had roaches and stuff like that."

The Backlash to the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Finally Here
By Jelisa Castrodale
August 27, 2019, 11:07am
Share:
This fall marks two decades since the release of Fight Club, director David Fincher’s dark celebration of toxic masculinity that also attacked, with two bruised and bloodied fists, consumerism and the pursuit of the so-called status quo. One of the most visceral scenes in a flick made entirely of visceral scenes was when a bare-chested, bare-knuckled Jack (Edward Norton) pins the platinum-haired and perfectly symmetrical Angel Face (Jared Leto) to the concrete floor and beats the absolute shit out of him. “I felt like destroying something beautiful,” Jack says after the underground fight.
The Popeye’s Chicken Sandwich was released just over two weeks ago, but after two weeks of being nothing short of obsessed with it, both online and in real life, we’ve reached the “I felt like destroying something beautiful” stage of appraising this breaded and spiced masterpiece. The inevitable backlash to the sandwich—or, more accurately, to the unyielding frenzy that the sandwich has created—is finally here. I am Jack’s grease-stained social conscience.

How I Stole $300 Million in Rare Diamonds | Informer
Last week, an employee at a Popeyes in Gainesville, Florida had to be hospitalized after falling during her shift. The Miami Herald called her “the first victim” of the “chicken sandwich wars,” after quoting a tweet alleging that she slipped on a floor that was slick with grease from hours of nonstop sandwich orders. A couple of days later, a photo of an overworked, exhausted Popeyes employee sitting outside a restaurant went viral, and eventually got the full meme treatment. Meme-ing a service industry worker whose wages will not increase despite the extra chaos at her workplace is whatever the opposite of dank is, but at least the most self-aware among us were quick to realize that. “I’m uncomfortable with that picture of the deflated, exhausted Popeye’s worker being used as a meme,” one person responded, a tweet that was liked 56,000 times.
A Medium post quickly followed, one that wondered whether the sandwich was “ethical,” following the ICE raids on seven chicken plants in central Mississippi, and the arrests and detention of some 680 workers. The author suggests that Popeyes sources its meat from processors like the ones that were targeted during the raids, the same kind of facilities that also rely heavily on an immigrant, largely Latinx workforce.
“The connection between immigrant labor and that piece of fried chicken is undeniable. The work of thousands of underpaid, mainly Latinx, men and women went into producing a product that can be sold cheaply and marketed to millions as the hot sandwich of the moment,” Matthew Lardie wrote. “Can you decry the current climate of targeted racism against Latinx migrants in America in one breath and take a giant bite of a sandwich they helped produce in the next?”
San Francisco Chronicle food critic Soleil Ho raised those same concerns, and she said we should spare a thought for the chickens, too. “And consider, for a moment, the life of the factory-farmed chicken that will eventually become a well-seasoned, fried mass at a place like Popeyes. The reality is likely worse than whatever you’ve imagined,” she wrote. (On the one hand, Popeyes has a lengthy-but-vague Animal Welfare Statement on its website; on the other, it also sold its fried combos in boxes labeled ‘Emotional Support Chicken’—boxes shaped like actual chickens—for a brief time at its Philadelphia Airport location.)
And even the most well-meaning efforts surrounding the Popeyes Chicken Situation feel completely precarious right now. Over the weekend, 17-year-old high school student David Ledbetter went to his local Popeyes and started registering people to vote while they stood in line, inching slowly toward the counter. “I once attended a caucus meeting in Charlotte and I noticed the lack of young people present,” he told Because of Them We Can. “I wanted to start an initiative to allow more youth to become politically involved, so I thought registering people to vote and handing out information on voting would be the best way to engage.” (He registered 16 people that day.)
Singer Janelle Monae made the same suggestion. ““Perhaps we put voting booths at every Popeyes location,” she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. “While we wait on that sammich you can register and vote @popeyes holla.” The backlash was swift (even John Legend weighed in) and she was roundly dragged for being elitist, and for shaming POC. Monae quickly posted a four-tweet apology thread.
“I think the tweets that I posted about registering and voting were insensitive and wrong—specifically they ignored the very real issues of voter suppression that have impacted my community for years and me directly,” she wrote. “Thanks to all of you for calling me out (or in) and helping me remember and refocus on the bigger issues.”
On Saturday, the manager of a Popeyes in Columbia County, Georgia, said that after enduring 45-minute lines, having to bring a cop in to direct drive-thru traffic, and a couple of minor chicken sandwich-related car accidents, he was considering pulling the sandwich off the menu at his restaurant.
No, that’s not the way this works. You have to let us destroy this beautiful thing ourselves.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (CNN Newsource/WMC/WKRC) - Popeyes has temporarily closed one of its locations after a former employee posted a viral video showing filthy, roach-infested conditions.
Roaches could be seen all around the restaurant, from food packaging to the deep fryers. Former employee Tykeia Ransom said that for nearly two months she had to work with roaches swarming the restaurant.
"Got a roach in the rice," said Ransom.

Ransom said that the roaches weren't the only unsanitary problem they had to deal with. She said that food, specifically bins of chicken, would be left out on the floor.
She also said that she tried multiple times to bring these issues up to management.
"I even got into it with the GM over the roaches being in the rice. Like, we got into it bad, she didn't even wanna throw it away she was like 'this is product,' I was like 'oh okay, but it has roaches in it. I'm not gonna serve that,'" said Ransom.
Ransom's video went viral and then one day later the Tennessee Department of Health did a "routine inspection" and gave the restaurant a score of 98.

There was only two violations listed, neither of them had anything to do with bugs.
This prompted corporate officials for Popeyes to release a statement.
"Even though the health department visited yesterday and confirmed no issues at the restaurant located at 4720 Showcase Boulevard, we shut it down. We thoroughly cleaned and will not reopen until we understand what happened and team members have been retrained on proper procedures."

Local media reached out to try and find out when the location would reopen but there was no response.

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.

A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.

At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

A Popeye's worker says she was fired after she blew the whistle on unsanitary conditions

While you may be able to get your fried chicken order “Louisiana Fast” from Popeyes, you may want to rethink your choice of fast-food chain if you’re in the Detroit area.
Shakita Shemere, a woman who worked at a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Detroit, lost her job after she shared a 20-minute video documenting the unsanitary conditions in the food storage and preparation areas. The video, which she told the Associated Press she started to film after her manager yelled at her because a cockroach frightened her, shows uncovered containers of what appears to be raw chicken in the freezer, dirty containers stacked to be reused instead of washed, and trash — which her fellow employees step over — littering the floor.
The 20-year-old is receiving comments that cleaning the mess would fall under her own job description, but she had mentioned in another Facebook post that she had only been working at the restaurant for three weeks.
She wrote, “Y’all keep saying it’s my fault cause I’m not cleaning… I been there three weeks tryna clean that shit them employees or managers don’t clean shit… I didn’t bring them roaches and say make yourself at home… they basically told me get out they house!”
“When I filled out that application, it didn’t say we got roaches, you gotta kill them, you have to step on them,” the woman told WXYZ. “It didn’t say they had dead flies on the ice.”
The restaurant was closed on Tuesday, and Detroit’s health department said that the store’s manager is cooperating and following cleaning protocols.

Please Don’t Meme Overworked Popeyes Employees
By Leila Ettachfini

Share:
The new Popeyes chicken sandwich has, as you may have heard, caused a chicken sandwich frenzy on and offline since its release on August 12. Ironically enough, the fast food chain known for its fried chicken had never sold a chicken sandwich before. While the new territory has been fun for food bloggers, chicken sandwich connoisseurs, and long-time lovers of the fast food chain, some Popeyes workers are not enjoying the madness as much. In fact, with Popeyes lines growing as everyone scurries to have a taste of the viral new sandwich, some workers say that it’s been overwhelming.
“I’ve worked at Popeyes for seven years and I’ve never seen shit like this, it’s fucking crazy, oh my fucking god,” said one Popeyes employee on Thursday at one of the chain’s Brooklyn locations.

“We’ve been packed nonstop, it’s every day with these fucking sandwiches,” said another employee at the same location.
As sandwich hysteria intensifies, with people questioning how the newcomer stands up against veteran chicken sandwiches like those of Chick-fil-A and Shake Shack, people have apparently been buying massive orders of the sandwiches to the point where some locations are running out of chicken. Meanwhile, at least one image of a Popeyes employee sitting on a bench looking tired is making the rounds on Twitter. While some have shown sympathy for employees like the person in the photo as their jobs become more demanding under the pull of the chicken sandwich, others have turned the image into a meme.
https://twitter.com/the3rd305/status/1164940241632997377
Naturally, some are upset about the photo, and understandably so. For one, despite the spike in business, Popeyes workers aren’t seeing any of these monetary gains in their own paychecks since they do not make tips or commission. According to PayScale, the average Popeyes employee makes $9.19. And on an ethical level, taking photos of an employee without their consent then posting them online to make fun of how overworked they must be is a pretty obviously a shitty thing to do.
https://twitter.com/N_I_K_Y_A_T_U/status/1164723741030584320
As the initial discourse from the Popeyes chicken sandwich mania gets old, some are turning their attention to the people making the delectable sandwiches possible. At least one woman has suggested turning the frenzy into a Popeyes worker’s rights movement. If even half of the energy behind the sandwich is put towards fighting for a livable minimum wage, perhaps Popeyes latest creation could become as iconic as everyone is pretending it is.

When I Fought Back Against Popeyes, Workers in Hundreds of Stores Won
WHEN I FOUGHT BACK AGAINST POPEYES, WORKERS IN HUNDREDS OF STORES WON
08/04/2022
Many fast-food chains must inform their workers that they're allowed to talk about union rights and their working conditions.
Share
Post

Hi, my name is Tia’Yonna Pringle. I’m a fast-food worker and a leader in the Fight for $15 and a Union. I joined this movement five years ago because like many other workers I was frustrated with the low wages and the little protections we received.
During the pandemic, I was working at a Popeyes in Tampa, FL making $10 per hour. On May 19, 2021, I decided to use my voice and join the strike to demand better working conditions.
Shortly after going on strike, Popeyes fired me. I was devastated and hurt. I considered myself close friends with the manager. I didn’t think standing up to protect myself in the workplace would come to this.
My son was five years old at that time, and I worried how we would get through this. I had bills to pay: rent, lights, phone, childcare. Everything was spinning out of control and we eventually got evicted. We moved in with my mom, and it took me almost five months to find another job.
What got me through all that was knowing that when workers strike together, we have power! I knew it was illegal for Popeyes or any other employer to discriminate or retaliate against workers for exercising our rights.
Yes: workers have the right to go on strike, and to talk about wages and working conditions.
With the help of Fight for $15 and a Union, I quickly filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge against the Popeyes store in Tampa, as well as against Sunholdings Inc, which manages over 1,200 other fast-food and retail stores in 12 states.
It was a long process, but after more than a year of fighting, I received news that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was able to resolve my case. Popeyes would have to:
- Reinstate me to my job;
- Pay my lost wages; and (get especially ready for the next one…)
- Require 100 Popeyes stores and over 500 other stores, including Arby's, Burger King, and Cici's Pizza locations, to change their rules so employees know they're able to talk about their union rights!!
- Require these stores to post a notice so all employees can read about their rights.
This was huge! I felt like my case would make a difference in so many workers' lives.
I’m proud that I took action and held Popeyes accountable. My story is just one of the many examples of why workers in every industry must have a strong and protected voice at work. Without that, it's very difficult to hold companies accountable … and thus make real change.
If there’s any advice I can leave with workers, it's this: Don’t be afraid to use your voice to create change in your workplace and community!

Threats, leg cramps, no breaks: what Popeyes workers put up with during the Sandwich craze
“We’re busting our butts and breaking our backs.”
by Alexia Fernández Campbell
Aug 28, 2019, 5:00 PM EDT
Popeyes customers wait in line to order chicken sandwiches on August 22, 2019, in Kyle, Texas. Eric Gay/AP Photo
The line twisted around tables inside the restaurant, crowding seated customers who were trying to eat the Sandwich. Yes, that sandwich.
The Popeyes restaurant on 14th Street in Washington, DC, was so packed late on a Tuesday afternoon that it was impossible to see the cashiers or cooks behind the counter.
“At lunchtime, the line was out the door,” an older woman who was panhandling outside the restaurant told me.
The craze over Popeyes’ new chicken sandwich — a fried chicken breast on brioche with pickles and either spicy or plain mayo — has prompted memes, hashtags, and endless selfies on social media since it launched last week. And lines. Long lines. By Tuesday, the company said it had run out of sandwiches.
“I’m exhausted,” said one cashier at the DC Popeyes on Wednesday. “We all are.”
The chicken sandwich, which takes about 10 minutes to make, is just the latest food item to go viral. Back in October 2017, customers yelled at McDonald’s staff when restaurants ran out of a limited supply of Szechuan sauce. A month later, hungry customers in Los Angeles waited up to an hour to get their hands on a Cronut. Every fall, Starbucks baristas have to deal with the dreaded pumpkin spice latte drinkers.
It’s all fun, right? Well, not for employees. They can’t take breaks. Food items run out. Customers freak out. And workers deal with it all while earning unlivable wages.
Wanda Lavender, a 38-year-old Popeyes manager, told me she doesn’t get paid enough to deal with all the customers who lined up for sandwiches this past week. She earns $10 an hour managing a Popeyes in Milwaukee. She told me her legs are still numb from standing for 10 to 12 hours a day — she had to spend her birthday making chicken sandwiches instead of taking the day off. One of her employees quit. An angry customer even threatened to shoot her staff.
“It was out of control,” she said Wednesday before her shift. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the Popeyes chain, did not respond to a request for comment as of publication time. Lavender is involved in the Fight for $15 movement that aims to raise wages and unionize fast-food workers across the country.
Below is a lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Lavender.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Were you expecting the sandwich to be so popular?
Wanda Lavender
I had no idea it was going to be that serious. They already had the sandwich in Chicago and it wasn’t a big deal. It’s just a sandwich; there is nothing special about it. Bread, meat, pickles, and mayo.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
What was it like that first day the sandwich went on sale?
Wanda Lavender
I went in thinking it was going to be a normal day. I got my Red Bull and went to work. I sat and watched someone make the sandwich so I could learn to make it. Then there were lines and lines outside the door. It’s almost like people were lining up to go to recess. Every day the lines just got longer; there was no break for anyone. I stood for 10 hours straight.
My legs were numb. I was getting [leg cramps] in the middle of the night. It’s exhausting work. My legs still haven’t recovered.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
What about your staff, how did they handle it?
Wanda Lavender
It was all hands on deck. There was no stopping. Sometimes employees stayed longer because it was so overwhelming for the person working next to them.
RELATED:The many, many conversations about fried chicken sandwiches, explained
It wasn’t just one person exhausted — everyone was exhausted. At first we were like, “C’mon, let’s do this. We’ve got this.” But the lines never cleared. All you could do was bow your head and take a deep breath. One lady quit; she couldn’t do it. It was too much. It’s overwhelming.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
How hard is it to make the sandwich?
Wanda Lavender
It takes about 10 minutes. Thirty seconds to toast the bread, and I think about seven minutes to cook the chicken. Then the mayo and pickles. I’ve made over 300 [sandwiches].
Alexia Fernández Campbell
How did the customers behave?
Wanda Lavender
We had a lot of good customers, but every now and then, we had one that made me want to reconsider working there. When we had the sandwich in stock, it was fine. It was when we ran out that people got angry.
People gotta understand that we’re going to run out of things. One guy yelled because we ran out of honey sauce. It was out of control. Another guy threatened to come back and shoot up the store.
It just doesn’t make sense. We are busting our butts and breaking our backs and someone threatens to shoot us because we ran out of something. That doesn’t scare me, but imagine what that’s like for an 18-year-old kid who works here? It scares the life out of them. It’s a hard pill to swallow. And all over some sandwich.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Do you feel like the company that owns Popeyes appreciates your hard work?
Wanda Lavender
The corporation made all this money — millions — off of these sandwiches, but where’s our cut? Where is our appreciation? Where is our thank-you? We made 5,000 sandwiches just in Wisconsin and sold every single one of them.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Do you think the sandwiches will come back on the menu?
Wanda Lavender
I don’t know. It’s still undetermined. It needs to be handled differently. Maybe put a limit. I had one person come in to purchase 15 sandwiches.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Is it worth putting up with all this for $10 an hour?
Wanda Lavender
Well, I’m not doing this just for kicks. I have six kids and I love every single one of them. If I work 10 hours a day, we’re just okay, but we’re not financially stable. It shouldn’t have to be this way.
I’m not lazy. I have done every job you can imagine. I was a loan officer, a lead generator, a research specialist, a day care teacher, but I’ve never been able to make more than $10 an hour. No one in my family has been able to.
I can pay the rent and the energy bill and the cellphone. That’s it. There’s no way to make sure the kids have everything they need, or even to dress halfway decent. Sometimes I braid hair to make extra money.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
So one more question. Have you tried the sandwich yet? What’s it like?
Wanda Lavender
It’s just a sandwich. I am just going to be honest, I feel like it could use some lettuce, tomato, and some cheese. To each their own.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Is there anything else you want to say?
Wanda Lavender
To all these corporations out there: Give us our due. Make sure you take care of the families who are taking care of you.

When Popeyes launched its chicken sandwich in early August, nobody expected it to go this far.






Popeyes and Chick-fil-A engaged in a Twitter battle last week over which chain's chicken sandwich was superior, following the rollout of Popeyes' new chicken sandwich.
The social media feud went viral, fueling unprecedented orders at Popeyes locations and a shortage of the menu item at many locations nationwide.
Many employees at Popeyes are working extra hours - some over 60 a week - to handle the demand. One employee said he was "working like a slave in the back" to fill sandwich orders during an 11-hour shift on Saturday.
Five Popeyes employees who spoke with Business Insider described long hours, massive crowds, and threats from hungry, angry customers.
"Popeyes restaurants experienced unprecedented volumes over the last couple of weeks. All restaurant employees have worked very hard. We are very grateful for all that they do for Popeyes guests," a Popeyes representative said in a statement to Business Insider.

When Popeyes launched its chicken sandwich in early August, nobody expected it to go this far.

Following the rollout of the new menu item, Popeyes and Chick-fil-A engaged in a battle via Twitter over which chain had the better sandwich. Even Wendy's got in on the action, but stalwart defenders of Popeyes rose to defend the sandwich that was crowned number one by Business Insider's fast-food critic, Irene Jiang, in a chicken sandwich head-to-head.

The Twitter feud and ensuing hype prompted a massive uptick in chicken sandwich orders at Popeyes, causing a shortage of the item at many locations.

For Popeyes and Chick-fil-A, the chicken sandwich war still rages on. And at the frontlines of the battle are the employees - managers, sandwich makers, shift leaders, and cashiers - some of whom are working more than 60-hour weeks and many days without breaks in order to quell the public's craving for chicken sandwiches.

Business Insider spoke with five Popeyes employees across the US about working at the chain during the so-called "chicken wars." Workers say that they are overwhelmed and exhausted, and many are considering quitting their jobs.

"I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo," said Carlos an 18-year-old Popeyes crew member in Orange County, California.

This employee and other Popeyes' workers have been granted anonymity in order to allow them to speak frankly about working conditions and the situation more generally at Popeyes. Employees told Business Insider that when the chicken sandwich was rolled out, the response was almost immediate and overwhelming.

"Popeyes restaurants experienced unprecedented volumes over the last couple of weeks. All restaurant employees have worked very hard. We are very grateful for all that they do for Popeyes guests," a Popeyes representative said in a statement to Business Insider.

'Everyone wanted to quit'

A Popeyes employeea nd other employees told Business Insider that when the chicken sandwich was rolled out, the response was almost immediate and overwhelming.

"Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad," he said. "We have never seen it get this insanely busy."

A Popeyes employee said his location sold out of the chicken sandwich at around 6 p.m. the first day. The next day, it was sold out by mid-day.


A Popeyes employee added: "My experience at Popeyes has been fine till this sandwich has come."

One now-former Popeyes employee who worked at a Newark, New Jersey, location told Business Insider that she actually did quit last Wednesday "in the middle of making two sandwiches." Crowds had been building at her location as the viral debate over who had the superior chicken sandwich raged.

"The issue with Popeyes or any fast food is the treatment and the amount of pay that a worker gets," the now-former employee said.

"The added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing," she added.

A part-time employee in a West Coast Popeyes said she and her coworkers usually don't take breaks until a minimum of four to five hours into their shifts.

"My coworkers said that there's been nights that they go home at 2 am when closing is at 11," the employee added. A high school senior, the employee said that her shifts have generally been bearable, though she has considered quitting if the store remains as busy at it has recently been.



Popeyes workers say the situation is getting dangerous in some locations

In some cases, the work environment at Popeyes has become dangerous.

"I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out," a manager at an East Coast Popeyes said.

She said that the lines at her location were like nothing she had ever experienced at work.

"You would think at the Popeyes I work in that there was a concert going on," she added.

"I had an instance where a customer was threatening to assault me when I was taking out trash," another employee said. "A customer sees me and shouts, 'Do we have a problem or what! Why no sandwiches! You guys are third Popeyes to say so! You better stop looking at me or else!' I was looking at the line."

The employee added that it is not uncommon for workers to go entire shifts without taking a break, saying that one coworker worked 65 hours over six days. This employee said their restaurant has shifted to mostly focusing on completing orders, neglecting certain tasks like sweeping and washing dishes for the time being. According to the Popeyes employee, many workers are looking for new jobs.

"It's pretty stressful," the employee said.



Popeyes' CEO says it has been a 'tough week' for workers

For many employees, the sudden overwhelming response to the new menu item was strange, considering the chicken sandwich had already been served in many locations for about a year.

In fact, when Business Insider went to taste test chicken sandwiches early in August, before the new sandwich had been officially announced, a Manhattan location was already serving it.

Now, getting a chicken sandwich is much more difficult. Reports of chicken sandwich shortages continued on Tuesday, sparking concerns that it might be a more long-term problem.

When Business Insider spoke with Jose Cil, the CEO of Popeyes' parent company Restaurant Brands International, last Friday, he acknowledged that it had been a "tough week" for many workers in stores.

"They've worked really hard, and actually the success that we've seen with the launch of the chicken sandwich is really a success that's been driven by our franchise partners as well as our team members and the restaurants," he said.

The Truth About Working At Popeyes Revealed By Workers
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
BY JOEL STICEUPDATED: JAN. 28, 2020 4:52 PM EST
The Popeyes chicken sandwich became one of the biggest food stories of 2019. 
This Louisiana-based chicken chain was a fast food staple long before they challenged Chick-fil-A's sandwich throne, though. In 1972, Alvin Copeland began serving his Cajun-flavored chicken in a New Orleans suburb and four years later he opened the first Popeyes restaurant.
There's no telling how many people Popeyes has employed in its 2,700 plus restaurants over the decades, but the brand has never been more popular. All the buzz around Popeyes' chicken sandwich has also resulted in the spotlight being directed on the the employees who keep Popeyes afloat and serve that delicious sandwich. 
Working in fast food can be tough work, and Popeyes employees are on their feet for hours at a time while they work to serve a hungry and sometimes impatient public. Often for only minimum wage or a few bucks more. 
The employees of this popular chicken chain have recently witnessed customer fights, and themselves been the target of threats from customers. It's not all chicken chaos though. The job does provide a stepping stone to customer service, and some restaurant employees have even found themselves climbing the corporate ranks. 
Straight from the employees of Popeyes, here's what it's like to work for one of the biggest names in fast food chicken.
The shifts can be grueling for Popeyes workers
YouTube
It's pretty much a given that if you work in the fast food business, you're going to be on your feet a lot. An employee of Popeyes could expect the occasional crowds of people during the lunch or dinner rush, but the introduction of the chicken sandwich only amplified that. 
The chicken sandwich has been nothing short of exhausting for the employees of Popeyes, and getting a break is almost unheard of. Popeyes' manager Wanda Lavender told Vox that she reportedly stands for 10 to 12 hours a day and that her "legs are still numb" from the work and "haven't recovered."
Lavender's experience is hardly the exception, and according to Business Insider, some Popeyes employees were pulling 60 hour weeks to meet the public's chicken sandwich demands. "I was working like a slave in the back prepping the buns with pickles and the spicy mayo,"  an anonymous Popeyes employee said. 
Even before the chicken sandwich craze, work at Popeyes was no walk in the park. A high school employee on Reddit said that they would work until 1 a.m. before getting up at the crack of dawn for school. 
Obviously, comfortable shoes are a must with this job.
The pay for Popeyes workers isn't very good
YouTube
The low pay for fast food employees has been a hot topic of debate for years, and Popeyes isn't an exception when it comes to the wages its employees earn. According to Indeed, the average hourly wage for a Popeyes crew member is about $9.50 an hour. That may be a little more than two bucks extra than the United States federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but many employees still feel it's hardly equal to the work of the job. 
Fran Marion, a Popeyes employee in Kansas City, Missouri who is a single mother of two children told The Guardian that despite working six days a week and a second job, she struggles to provide for her family. "It makes me feel like a peasant," Marion said. "In a way it's slavery. It's economic slavery." 
Popeyes managers do earn a little more at an average of $12.93 an hour, but even working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, that's not even an annual salary of $26,000. 
According to Popeyes' website, the company does off certain benefits such as education assistance, a 401(k), and "cash awards on your employment anniversary." Who knows how many of Popeyes' fast food employees are actually getting these benefits, and despite the company having a score of 2.8 out of five on Indeed in the pay category, it has an overall score of 3.5 stars out of five.
The customers at Popeyes can sometimes be hostile to employees
YouTube
Anybody who has ever worked in fast food will tell you that it can be a very tiring job. Aside from the long hours and low pay, employees also have to deal with their fair share of rude customers. "Two times people threw drinks back at me when I worked drive-thru," one former Popeyes employee said on Reddit. 
Rude customers are nothing new in fast food, and the demand for Popeyes' chicken sandwich has brought with it numerous incidents of hostile customer behavior. When the chicken sandwich first rolled out in August of 2018, Popeyes manager Wanda Lavender said one disgruntled customer threatened to shoot the staff over the sandwich. "It was out of control," Lavender said. 
"I had an instance where a customer was threatening to assault me when I was taking out trash," another employee said. 
Similar incidents have happened at other locations too. Police in Houston responded to a call that a drive-thru customer brandished a gun when they were told there were no more sandwiches (via The Guardian). 
The sandwich was briefly taken off the menu when Popeyes couldn't keep up with demand, but when it came back the rude customers returned along with it. A man in Harlem, New York was captured on video berating employees because they weren't making the sandwiches quick enough. 
Working with the public isn't always easy, but at Popeyes, it can be downright dangerous.
It's not unusual for employees to abruptly quit Popeyes

With the long hours, low pay, and occasionally rude customer, it doesn't come as a surprise that some Popeyes employees quit on the spot. People can only be pushed so far in a job before they reach the breaking point, and the chicken sandwich madness has ushered in that breaking point for numerous Popeyes employees. 
"Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad," one Popeyes crew member in Orange County, California told Business Insider.  "We have never seen it get this insanely busy." Another employee at a New Jersey restaurant said that she abruptly quit right in the middle of putting together two sandwiches for customers. 
Manager Wanda Lavender told Vox that she too has had employees quit on the spot because the job just became too stressful to handle. "It was too much," Lavendar said before adding "It's overwhelming."
While some Popeyes employees may decide to take their chances and look for another job, quitting isn't an option for others such as Lavender, who has six children to care for. "I'm not doing this just for kicks."
Getting hired at Popeyes isn't too difficult
Twitter
If you're in need of a job and have a Popeyes restaurant not too far away, they might be viable place to put in an application. Considering the hectic pace of the job, is it really all that surprising that Popeyes doesn't require potential employees to jump through too many hoops? 
Popeyes general manager Jordan Suriano says that if you can get an interview, then you'll likely get the job. Just as long as you don't come in smelling like a pot dispensary. "It happens fairly often," Suriano said before adding, "If you don't get a call back after submitting an application call to check up on the status of your application and let them know you are still interested."
A Popeyes employee on Indeed seemed to back up Suriano's tip and said that after applying online and having an interview, they called back and got hired over the phone. 
Now when it comes to getting a job in the Popeyes corporate offices, that can be a little trickier according to Garrison Xian, who spent a summer interning at Popeyes. "For the corporate office it has become a very competitive process as now applicants have to apply to Restaurant Brand International," Xian said." It is a very long process with three rounds of interviews and a 'superday.'"
Getting fired from Popeyes is pretty easy too
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
The fast food industry has a high turnover rate — like, ridiculously high. 
According to CNBC, turnover in the restaurant industry is around 130 percent a year, largely because fast food jobs aren't particularly desirable for many of the reasons outlined above. But not all of those workers are quitting.
Always showing up late or simply not doing the required work will get a person fired in any job, but Popeyes employees have been fired for a whole range of reasons. In 2015, a Popeyes worker claimed they were fired after refusing to pay back money that was stolen during an armed robbery. In August 2019, Popeyes canned employees for putting too much cayenne pepper in the store's chicken sandwiches. 
Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising example of Popeyes employees getting the ax came from a former restaurant manager on Reddit. According to the manager, several months after the Popeyes restaurant opened, a regional supervisor told him "Tomorrow an RV will be parked in the parking lot when you arrive. Send each employee out to take a polygraph before they clock in. Tell them, 'We're not looking for food theft. If you gave away food or ate food without paying for it just admit it so you don't get tagged as deceptive. We're looking for somebody who stole money.'"
The Popeyes manager said they suspected a real polygraph wasn't used, but regardless, half the store's employees were fired because of the ruse.
You get free food if you work at Popeyes, but might start to dislike fried chicken
Facebook
Popeyes is famous for their fried chicken and one perk of the job is that employees may get a free meal of that chicken while on their shift. 
"If the manager is chill enough they might let you have a 5-minute break and eat whatever you want," one employee said on Quora. While some employees on Glassdoor backed up this claim, others contradicted it and said they were only given a discount on select items while working their shift. "I feel like it should be better than what it is if you work over eight hours you should get a free meal," one employee said. 
Even if employees are getting some free food, that free fried chicken can get old pretty quick when the smell follows you home. If you're knee-deep in fried chicken for hours at a time, that smell is going to stick to you and it won't be long before your car starts to smell like the Popeyes kitchen. 
"Oh my god, you would not believe the amount of air fresheners I go through just to try and keep the smell of chicken sweat and my bad life decisions away," confessed one employee on Reddit.
Some employees feel that Popeyes is taking advantage of them
Twitter
According to Forbes, when Popeyes chicken sandwich returned in November of 2019, Popeyes' traffic was 300 percent above normal and even higher than when the sandwich initially launched. What's good for Popeyes as a whole, however, hasn't necessarily trickled down to the employees making the sandwich. 
"The corporation made all this money — millions — off of these sandwiches, but where's our cut? Where is our appreciation? Where is our thank-you? We made 5,000 sandwiches just in Wisconsin and sold every single one of them," Popeyes employee Wanda Lavender said.  
Fran Marion, who was working at Popeyes before the chicken sandwich came along, grosses around $950 for Popeyes taking orders in a seven-hour shift, but only takes home $76 (via The Guardian). Marion feels that Popeyes should pay its crew members a higher wage. "It's united we stand or divided we fall," Marion said. 
When asked by Business Insider about the overworked fast food employees, Popeyes CEO Jose Cil said it was a "tough week" for crew members around the country and said the sandwich's success was "driven by our franchise partners as well as our team members."
While that may be a verbal pat on the back, Popeyes workers would likely prefer a monetary one. "The added demand increased the amount of work tenfold, while I still get paid next to nothing," confessed one employee.
Mardi Gras is the busiest time for Popeyes employees
Eric Baradat/Getty Images
The slam of the chicken sandwich will end eventually — at least that's what Popeyes employees are undoubtedly hoping for. After that, it'll be back to business as usual. That doesn't mean that Popeyes doesn't experience busy times of the season, though. The same way that Long John Silvers gets busy around Lent, Popeyes locations in the New Orleans area gets slammed with customers every February when Mardi Gras rolls around. 
It's not unusual for Popeyes locations to serve as much as 40 tons of red beans and rice, 1.5 million pieces of chicken, and over a million biscuits throughout the 12 day Mardi Gras celebration (via QSR). To keep up with that demand, the restaurants must hire extra staff and extend their normal business hours to nearly 24 hours a day in order to meet customers' needs as they head to and from various Mardi Gras events.  
"Mardi Gras is one of our biggest times of the year," vice president of operations, Dwayne Fontenette told Nola. "We open up at five o'clock in the morning... just to get ready for the parades."
Had Popeyes rolled out its chicken sandwich during Mardi Gras, well, it may have simply been too much for the staff to handle.
Some Popeyes employees enjoy the job
YouTube
Despite the long hours, lower wages, and potentially hostile customers, a lot of Popeyes workers take great pride in their work and some enjoy the job. One Popeyes employee on Quora said that they enjoyed numerous aspects of the job, from the crew member camaraderie to the customer interactions, fast pace of the work, and even the cleaning once the store was shut down. 
"Even though it's not a professional job, it is quite interesting to work at a Popeyes," the employee said, adding "Especially since it's my first job."
Other Popeyes employees expressed a similar satisfaction with the job and said that it provided them with a chance to serve people in their community. "Great opportunity to get a chance to work with the general working population and gain pointers on customer service," former employee Denise Davis said. 
While a lot of employees on Indeed did say that the work could be tiring for their small paycheck, numerous employees agreed that their coworkers made all the difference. "My coworkers where my biggest joy throughout my time at Popeyes, one employee said. "We created a bond like family and looked out for one another day after day."
Working at Popeyes may not be the perfect job, but it can certainly be a decent place to start if you need a steady paycheck and want some customer service experience.
If you can stick it out at Popeyes, there's the opportunity to grow
Eric Baradat/Getty Images
Working at Popeyes for the long haul obviously isn't going to be the right path for every employee, but for those who can hang in, there is an opportunity to move up through the ranks of the organization. 
While one employee on Indeed said that numerous changes in management did impact the morale of some employees, they said that they "worked hard and moved up quickly." Other employees voiced similar opinions, but noted that climbing the ladder gets more difficult after being moved up to the role of assistant manager. 
To be fair, climbing to the top of any organization is almost always going to be difficult, but as vice president of operations, Dwayne Fontenette proves — it can be done. "A lot of our employees start out as hourly employees and move up to management," Fontenette said. "Like myself, I moved up to the vice president of operations and I started out at the Popeyes on Read Boulevard in August of '84... first job out of high school." 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna call the shots at Popeyes.

Popeyes ownership responds after viral videos expose filth at Detroit store

DETROIT (WJBK) - A Popeye's worker exposed filthy conditions at an east side location in Detroit by posting videos online. 
Cell phone video of roaches, maggots and unsanitary conditions prompted the Detroit Health Department to pay a visit to the store on Gratiot and Seven Mile.
The video was recorded by an employee who claims to have brought these conditions to the attention of management but felt ignored, so she posted it online and it went viral.
FOX 2 saw an exterminator and several Popeyes employees inside the closed restaurant Tuesday. Detroit police were also at the scene to keep the onlookers moving. 
A cleaning crew remained on scene most of the afternoon, while Popeyes media relations released this statement:
"Food safety and quality is always a top priority for the Popeyes brand. The Franchisee who owns and operates this location has worked with local health officials to ensure that the restaurant is thoroughly sanitized and safe. At this time, the restaurant is fully operational after passing all health inspections."
Despite the statement from ownership, cones were placed in the parking lot and the doors were locked at least for the night. 
"You've got to shut the store down, get the news out here and everything just to get it cleaned up," said Janel McCloud. "That's not right."
McCloud works at a different Popeyes in Detroit but eats at this location from time to time. Last week she saw first-hand just some of what was recorded on video. 
"What I saw was roaches," McCloud said. "When I went to the restroom to wash my hands before I ate and stuff like that. I saw roaches and I saw them when I was ordering."
And she says this isn't the first time the bugs have been spotted inside. 
"It has been like this for a while," McCloud said. "Because my little sister used to work here and she said they had roaches and stuff like that."

The Backlash to the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Finally Here
By Jelisa Castrodale
August 27, 2019, 11:07am
Share:
This fall marks two decades since the release of Fight Club, director David Fincher’s dark celebration of toxic masculinity that also attacked, with two bruised and bloodied fists, consumerism and the pursuit of the so-called status quo. One of the most visceral scenes in a flick made entirely of visceral scenes was when a bare-chested, bare-knuckled Jack (Edward Norton) pins the platinum-haired and perfectly symmetrical Angel Face (Jared Leto) to the concrete floor and beats the absolute shit out of him. “I felt like destroying something beautiful,” Jack says after the underground fight.
The Popeye’s Chicken Sandwich was released just over two weeks ago, but after two weeks of being nothing short of obsessed with it, both online and in real life, we’ve reached the “I felt like destroying something beautiful” stage of appraising this breaded and spiced masterpiece. The inevitable backlash to the sandwich—or, more accurately, to the unyielding frenzy that the sandwich has created—is finally here. I am Jack’s grease-stained social conscience.

How I Stole $300 Million in Rare Diamonds | Informer
Last week, an employee at a Popeyes in Gainesville, Florida had to be hospitalized after falling during her shift. The Miami Herald called her “the first victim” of the “chicken sandwich wars,” after quoting a tweet alleging that she slipped on a floor that was slick with grease from hours of nonstop sandwich orders. A couple of days later, a photo of an overworked, exhausted Popeyes employee sitting outside a restaurant went viral, and eventually got the full meme treatment. Meme-ing a service industry worker whose wages will not increase despite the extra chaos at her workplace is whatever the opposite of dank is, but at least the most self-aware among us were quick to realize that. “I’m uncomfortable with that picture of the deflated, exhausted Popeye’s worker being used as a meme,” one person responded, a tweet that was liked 56,000 times.
A Medium post quickly followed, one that wondered whether the sandwich was “ethical,” following the ICE raids on seven chicken plants in central Mississippi, and the arrests and detention of some 680 workers. The author suggests that Popeyes sources its meat from processors like the ones that were targeted during the raids, the same kind of facilities that also rely heavily on an immigrant, largely Latinx workforce.
“The connection between immigrant labor and that piece of fried chicken is undeniable. The work of thousands of underpaid, mainly Latinx, men and women went into producing a product that can be sold cheaply and marketed to millions as the hot sandwich of the moment,” Matthew Lardie wrote. “Can you decry the current climate of targeted racism against Latinx migrants in America in one breath and take a giant bite of a sandwich they helped produce in the next?”
San Francisco Chronicle food critic Soleil Ho raised those same concerns, and she said we should spare a thought for the chickens, too. “And consider, for a moment, the life of the factory-farmed chicken that will eventually become a well-seasoned, fried mass at a place like Popeyes. The reality is likely worse than whatever you’ve imagined,” she wrote. (On the one hand, Popeyes has a lengthy-but-vague Animal Welfare Statement on its website; on the other, it also sold its fried combos in boxes labeled ‘Emotional Support Chicken’—boxes shaped like actual chickens—for a brief time at its Philadelphia Airport location.)
And even the most well-meaning efforts surrounding the Popeyes Chicken Situation feel completely precarious right now. Over the weekend, 17-year-old high school student David Ledbetter went to his local Popeyes and started registering people to vote while they stood in line, inching slowly toward the counter. “I once attended a caucus meeting in Charlotte and I noticed the lack of young people present,” he told Because of Them We Can. “I wanted to start an initiative to allow more youth to become politically involved, so I thought registering people to vote and handing out information on voting would be the best way to engage.” (He registered 16 people that day.)
Singer Janelle Monae made the same suggestion. ““Perhaps we put voting booths at every Popeyes location,” she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. “While we wait on that sammich you can register and vote @popeyes holla.” The backlash was swift (even John Legend weighed in) and she was roundly dragged for being elitist, and for shaming POC. Monae quickly posted a four-tweet apology thread.
“I think the tweets that I posted about registering and voting were insensitive and wrong—specifically they ignored the very real issues of voter suppression that have impacted my community for years and me directly,” she wrote. “Thanks to all of you for calling me out (or in) and helping me remember and refocus on the bigger issues.”
On Saturday, the manager of a Popeyes in Columbia County, Georgia, said that after enduring 45-minute lines, having to bring a cop in to direct drive-thru traffic, and a couple of minor chicken sandwich-related car accidents, he was considering pulling the sandwich off the menu at his restaurant.
No, that’s not the way this works. You have to let us destroy this beautiful thing ourselves.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (CNN Newsource/WMC/WKRC) - Popeyes has temporarily closed one of its locations after a former employee posted a viral video showing filthy, roach-infested conditions.
Roaches could be seen all around the restaurant, from food packaging to the deep fryers. Former employee Tykeia Ransom said that for nearly two months she had to work with roaches swarming the restaurant.
"Got a roach in the rice," said Ransom.

Ransom said that the roaches weren't the only unsanitary problem they had to deal with. She said that food, specifically bins of chicken, would be left out on the floor.
She also said that she tried multiple times to bring these issues up to management.
"I even got into it with the GM over the roaches being in the rice. Like, we got into it bad, she didn't even wanna throw it away she was like 'this is product,' I was like 'oh okay, but it has roaches in it. I'm not gonna serve that,'" said Ransom.
Ransom's video went viral and then one day later the Tennessee Department of Health did a "routine inspection" and gave the restaurant a score of 98.

There was only two violations listed, neither of them had anything to do with bugs.
This prompted corporate officials for Popeyes to release a statement.
"Even though the health department visited yesterday and confirmed no issues at the restaurant located at 4720 Showcase Boulevard, we shut it down. We thoroughly cleaned and will not reopen until we understand what happened and team members have been retrained on proper procedures."

Local media reached out to try and find out when the location would reopen but there was no response.

Employees at Oakland Popeyes allege illegal child labor practices, harassment

Employees at a Popeyes in Oakland picketed this week after teen workers, including one who was 13, alleged that they were pressured to work long, late hours in violation of child labor laws.
“Our employer has violated almost every law put in place to protect young workers like us,” two of the younger employees wrote in a statement.
Johmara Romero, 17, and Karla Palma Mendoza, who turned 18 Friday, filed a complaint with the California labor commissioner and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, also known as Cal/OSHA, claiming violations at the Popeyes on International Boulevard in Oakland.

A spokesperson for the Department of Industrial Relations confirmed receipt of the complaint and said Cal/OSHA was investigating the worksite.
Johmara and Palma said they were often assigned shifts much longer than four hours and well beyond 10 p.m. on school nights — the legal limit for workers their age. The two employees, who were in high school while working at the restaurant, said they often were asked to stay until 11:30 p.m. or work for 6.5 hours on a school nights, sometimes without the required break times.
The managers who hired them never asked for the necessary work permits required for employees their age, the workers wrote in a statement that was distributed by Fight for $15, a group that represents and advocates for underpaid workers. In California, the group led the charge to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint included details about a 13-year-old employee who on multiple occasions worked more than 40 hours a week, including staying until midnight on school nights. State law does not allow 13-year-olds to work on school days.
After the complaint was filed — and before employees took to the picket line Thursday and Friday — Popeyes shuttered that location, according to First for $15. Popeyes representatives did not respond to question from The Times, but other media outlets reported the company promised an investigation.
“We will not tolerate any violation of employment laws and if any of these allegations prove true, we will take action against this franchisee,” a Popeyes spokesperson told the Washington Post.

At the strike Thursday, workers rallied outside the store, holding signs that read “Popeyes, stop exploiting child labor,” and chanting, “Qué queremos? Justicia! Cuándo? Ahora!” which translates to, “What do we want? Justice! When? Now!”
“One time I worked until 11p.m. on a school night, and I was late for school the next morning, because I overslept,” Johmara wrote in a statement. “One time they called me into work at noon on a school day, even though school goes until 2:30 pm, because they were short-staffed, so I skipped school that day.”
In their complaint, the employees also described repeated harassment at work from managers, including sexual harassment; not being allowed to take breaks, which are legally required; and not being compensated for overtime.
The workers also said they were concerned about their safety after incidents of violence, including a fight between staff and a customer that was recorded on video this year.
A video that appeared to match the fight described in the complaint was posted on Twitter in February. The official Popeyes account said it was “horrified to see the events that took place” in Oakland.
“We have no tolerance for violence of any kind in our restaurants,” the statement said. “We are working with the Franchisee who owns and operates this location to ensure violence like this does not happen again.”

A Popeye's worker says she was fired after she blew the whistle on unsanitary conditions

While you may be able to get your fried chicken order “Louisiana Fast” from Popeyes, you may want to rethink your choice of fast-food chain if you’re in the Detroit area.
Shakita Shemere, a woman who worked at a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Detroit, lost her job after she shared a 20-minute video documenting the unsanitary conditions in the food storage and preparation areas. The video, which she told the Associated Press she started to film after her manager yelled at her because a cockroach frightened her, shows uncovered containers of what appears to be raw chicken in the freezer, dirty containers stacked to be reused instead of washed, and trash — which her fellow employees step over — littering the floor.
The 20-year-old is receiving comments that cleaning the mess would fall under her own job description, but she had mentioned in another Facebook post that she had only been working at the restaurant for three weeks.
She wrote, “Y’all keep saying it’s my fault cause I’m not cleaning… I been there three weeks tryna clean that shit them employees or managers don’t clean shit… I didn’t bring them roaches and say make yourself at home… they basically told me get out they house!”
“When I filled out that application, it didn’t say we got roaches, you gotta kill them, you have to step on them,” the woman told WXYZ. “It didn’t say they had dead flies on the ice.”
The restaurant was closed on Tuesday, and Detroit’s health department said that the store’s manager is cooperating and following cleaning protocols.

Please Don’t Meme Overworked Popeyes Employees
By Leila Ettachfini

Share:
The new Popeyes chicken sandwich has, as you may have heard, caused a chicken sandwich frenzy on and offline since its release on August 12. Ironically enough, the fast food chain known for its fried chicken had never sold a chicken sandwich before. While the new territory has been fun for food bloggers, chicken sandwich connoisseurs, and long-time lovers of the fast food chain, some Popeyes workers are not enjoying the madness as much. In fact, with Popeyes lines growing as everyone scurries to have a taste of the viral new sandwich, some workers say that it’s been overwhelming.
“I’ve worked at Popeyes for seven years and I’ve never seen shit like this, it’s fucking crazy, oh my fucking god,” said one Popeyes employee on Thursday at one of the chain’s Brooklyn locations.

“We’ve been packed nonstop, it’s every day with these fucking sandwiches,” said another employee at the same location.
As sandwich hysteria intensifies, with people questioning how the newcomer stands up against veteran chicken sandwiches like those of Chick-fil-A and Shake Shack, people have apparently been buying massive orders of the sandwiches to the point where some locations are running out of chicken. Meanwhile, at least one image of a Popeyes employee sitting on a bench looking tired is making the rounds on Twitter. While some have shown sympathy for employees like the person in the photo as their jobs become more demanding under the pull of the chicken sandwich, others have turned the image into a meme.
https://twitter.com/the3rd305/status/1164940241632997377
Naturally, some are upset about the photo, and understandably so. For one, despite the spike in business, Popeyes workers aren’t seeing any of these monetary gains in their own paychecks since they do not make tips or commission. According to PayScale, the average Popeyes employee makes $9.19. And on an ethical level, taking photos of an employee without their consent then posting them online to make fun of how overworked they must be is a pretty obviously a shitty thing to do.
https://twitter.com/N_I_K_Y_A_T_U/status/1164723741030584320
As the initial discourse from the Popeyes chicken sandwich mania gets old, some are turning their attention to the people making the delectable sandwiches possible. At least one woman has suggested turning the frenzy into a Popeyes worker’s rights movement. If even half of the energy behind the sandwich is put towards fighting for a livable minimum wage, perhaps Popeyes latest creation could become as iconic as everyone is pretending it is.

When I Fought Back Against Popeyes, Workers in Hundreds of Stores Won
WHEN I FOUGHT BACK AGAINST POPEYES, WORKERS IN HUNDREDS OF STORES WON
08/04/2022
Many fast-food chains must inform their workers that they're allowed to talk about union rights and their working conditions.
Share
Post

Hi, my name is Tia’Yonna Pringle. I’m a fast-food worker and a leader in the Fight for $15 and a Union. I joined this movement five years ago because like many other workers I was frustrated with the low wages and the little protections we received.
During the pandemic, I was working at a Popeyes in Tampa, FL making $10 per hour. On May 19, 2021, I decided to use my voice and join the strike to demand better working conditions.
Shortly after going on strike, Popeyes fired me. I was devastated and hurt. I considered myself close friends with the manager. I didn’t think standing up to protect myself in the workplace would come to this.
My son was five years old at that time, and I worried how we would get through this. I had bills to pay: rent, lights, phone, childcare. Everything was spinning out of control and we eventually got evicted. We moved in with my mom, and it took me almost five months to find another job.
What got me through all that was knowing that when workers strike together, we have power! I knew it was illegal for Popeyes or any other employer to discriminate or retaliate against workers for exercising our rights.
Yes: workers have the right to go on strike, and to talk about wages and working conditions.
With the help of Fight for $15 and a Union, I quickly filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge against the Popeyes store in Tampa, as well as against Sunholdings Inc, which manages over 1,200 other fast-food and retail stores in 12 states.
It was a long process, but after more than a year of fighting, I received news that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was able to resolve my case. Popeyes would have to:
- Reinstate me to my job;
- Pay my lost wages; and (get especially ready for the next one…)
- Require 100 Popeyes stores and over 500 other stores, including Arby's, Burger King, and Cici's Pizza locations, to change their rules so employees know they're able to talk about their union rights!!
- Require these stores to post a notice so all employees can read about their rights.
This was huge! I felt like my case would make a difference in so many workers' lives.
I’m proud that I took action and held Popeyes accountable. My story is just one of the many examples of why workers in every industry must have a strong and protected voice at work. Without that, it's very difficult to hold companies accountable … and thus make real change.
If there’s any advice I can leave with workers, it's this: Don’t be afraid to use your voice to create change in your workplace and community!

Threats, leg cramps, no breaks: what Popeyes workers put up with during the Sandwich craze
“We’re busting our butts and breaking our backs.”
by Alexia Fernández Campbell

The line twisted around tables inside the restaurant, crowding seated customers who were trying to eat the Sandwich. Yes, that sandwich.
The Popeyes restaurant on 14th Street in Washington, DC, was so packed late on a Tuesday afternoon that it was impossible to see the cashiers or cooks behind the counter.
“At lunchtime, the line was out the door,” an older woman who was panhandling outside the restaurant told me.
The craze over Popeyes’ new chicken sandwich — a fried chicken breast on brioche with pickles and either spicy or plain mayo — has prompted memes, hashtags, and endless selfies on social media since it launched last week. And lines. Long lines. By Tuesday, the company said it had run out of sandwiches.
“I’m exhausted,” said one cashier at the DC Popeyes on Wednesday. “We all are.”
The chicken sandwich, which takes about 10 minutes to make, is just the latest food item to go viral. Back in October 2017, customers yelled at McDonald’s staff when restaurants ran out of a limited supply of Szechuan sauce. A month later, hungry customers in Los Angeles waited up to an hour to get their hands on a Cronut. Every fall, Starbucks baristas have to deal with the dreaded pumpkin spice latte drinkers.
It’s all fun, right? Well, not for employees. They can’t take breaks. Food items run out. Customers freak out. And workers deal with it all while earning unlivable wages.
Wanda Lavender, a 38-year-old Popeyes manager, told me she doesn’t get paid enough to deal with all the customers who lined up for sandwiches this past week. She earns $10 an hour managing a Popeyes in Milwaukee. She told me her legs are still numb from standing for 10 to 12 hours a day — she had to spend her birthday making chicken sandwiches instead of taking the day off. One of her employees quit. An angry customer even threatened to shoot her staff.
“It was out of control,” she said Wednesday before her shift. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the Popeyes chain, did not respond to a request for comment as of publication time. Lavender is involved in the Fight for $15 movement that aims to raise wages and unionize fast-food workers across the country.
Below is a lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Lavender.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Were you expecting the sandwich to be so popular?
Wanda Lavender
I had no idea it was going to be that serious. They already had the sandwich in Chicago and it wasn’t a big deal. It’s just a sandwich; there is nothing special about it. Bread, meat, pickles, and mayo.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
What was it like that first day the sandwich went on sale?
Wanda Lavender
I went in thinking it was going to be a normal day. I got my Red Bull and went to work. I sat and watched someone make the sandwich so I could learn to make it. Then there were lines and lines outside the door. It’s almost like people were lining up to go to recess. Every day the lines just got longer; there was no break for anyone. I stood for 10 hours straight.
My legs were numb. I was getting [leg cramps] in the middle of the night. It’s exhausting work. My legs still haven’t recovered.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
What about your staff, how did they handle it?
Wanda Lavender
It was all hands on deck. There was no stopping. Sometimes employees stayed longer because it was so overwhelming for the person working next to them.
RELATED:The many, many conversations about fried chicken sandwiches, explained
It wasn’t just one person exhausted — everyone was exhausted. At first we were like, “C’mon, let’s do this. We’ve got this.” But the lines never cleared. All you could do was bow your head and take a deep breath. One lady quit; she couldn’t do it. It was too much. It’s overwhelming.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
How hard is it to make the sandwich?
Wanda Lavender
It takes about 10 minutes. Thirty seconds to toast the bread, and I think about seven minutes to cook the chicken. Then the mayo and pickles. I’ve made over 300 [sandwiches].
Alexia Fernández Campbell
How did the customers behave?
Wanda Lavender
We had a lot of good customers, but every now and then, we had one that made me want to reconsider working there. When we had the sandwich in stock, it was fine. It was when we ran out that people got angry.
People gotta understand that we’re going to run out of things. One guy yelled because we ran out of honey sauce. It was out of control. Another guy threatened to come back and shoot up the store.
It just doesn’t make sense. We are busting our butts and breaking our backs and someone threatens to shoot us because we ran out of something. That doesn’t scare me, but imagine what that’s like for an 18-year-old kid who works here? It scares the life out of them. It’s a hard pill to swallow. And all over some sandwich.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Do you feel like the company that owns Popeyes appreciates your hard work?
Wanda Lavender
The corporation made all this money — millions — off of these sandwiches, but where’s our cut? Where is our appreciation? Where is our thank-you? We made 5,000 sandwiches just in Wisconsin and sold every single one of them.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Do you think the sandwiches will come back on the menu?
Wanda Lavender
I don’t know. It’s still undetermined. It needs to be handled differently. Maybe put a limit. I had one person come in to purchase 15 sandwiches.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Is it worth putting up with all this for $10 an hour?
Wanda Lavender
Well, I’m not doing this just for kicks. I have six kids and I love every single one of them. If I work 10 hours a day, we’re just okay, but we’re not financially stable. It shouldn’t have to be this way.
I’m not lazy. I have done every job you can imagine. I was a loan officer, a lead generator, a research specialist, a day care teacher, but I’ve never been able to make more than $10 an hour. No one in my family has been able to.
I can pay the rent and the energy bill and the cellphone. That’s it. There’s no way to make sure the kids have everything they need, or even to dress halfway decent. Sometimes I braid hair to make extra money.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
So one more question. Have you tried the sandwich yet? What’s it like?
Wanda Lavender
It’s just a sandwich. I am just going to be honest, I feel like it could use some lettuce, tomato, and some cheese. To each their own.
Alexia Fernández Campbell
Is there anything else you want to say?
Wanda Lavender
To all these corporations out there: Give us our due. Make sure you take care of the families who are taking care of you.

With the fast-food fried chicken market expected to reach nearly $10 billion by 2030, the stakes have never been higher.

The Lay of the Land: Market Size and Growth
The fast-food fried chicken market in the US is a juggernaut, with a projected market size of $9.7 billion by 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.2% from 2020 to 2030. The market‘s growth is driven by factors such as increasing disposable income, the popularity of quick-service restaurants, and the growing demand for convenient and affordable meal options.
Currently, Popeyes holds the third-largest market share in the fried chicken segment, trailing behind industry giants KFC and Chick-fil-A. However, the company has seen steady growth in recent years, thanks in part to the viral success of its fried chicken sandwich, launched in 2019.
Competitor Market Share (%) Revenue (2020, in billions)
KFC 28.5% $4.7
Chick-fil-A 24.3% $11.3

1. KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken)
With over 4,000 locations across the US and a global presence in 145 countries, KFC is the world‘s largest fried chicken chain.

The Strategies: How Competitors Are Vying for Market Share
To stand out in the crowded fast-food fried chicken market, Popeyes‘ competitors employ a range of strategies, including:
1. Menu Innovation
Many competitors continuously introduce new menu items to keep customers engaged and attract new ones. For example, KFC recently launched its "Kentucky Fried Chicken & Donuts" sandwich, while Chick-fil-A introduced a spicy chicken sandwich and a kale crunch side. These innovations help competitors stay relevant and cater to changing consumer preferences.
2. Value Propositions
Offering competitive prices and value meals is crucial in the fast-food industry. Church‘s Chicken, for instance, focuses on value with its $5 Real Big Deal, which includes a choice of chicken, biscuit, and a side. Bojangles also offers a variety of value combos, such as the "4 for $4" deal, which includes a choice of sandwich, fries, and a drink.
3. Target Demographics
Some competitors focus on specific demographics to build a loyal customer base. Chick-fil-A, for example, targets families and Christian customers with its family-friendly atmosphere and closed-on-Sundays policy. Zaxby‘s, on the other hand, focuses on college students and sports fans through its sponsorships and partnerships.
4. Customer Experience
Providing exceptional customer service and a pleasant dining experience can help competitors differentiate themselves. Chick-fil-A is renowned for its friendly staff and "my pleasure" catchphrase, which contributes to its strong customer loyalty. KFC has also focused on improving its customer experience, with initiatives such as digital ordering kiosks and mobile app rewards.
5. Brand Identity
A strong, recognizable brand identity is essential in the fast-food industry. KFC‘s success is partly due to its iconic founder, Colonel Sanders, and its long-standing secret recipe. Bojangles‘ regional focus and Southern-inspired menu help it maintain a loyal customer base in the Southeastern US. Popeyes has also leveraged its Louisiana heritage and bold flavors to create a distinct brand identity.
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Fast-Food Fried Chicken Market
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the fast-food industry, including the fried chicken market. As dining rooms closed and consumers shifted to takeout and delivery, competitors had to quickly adapt their strategies to meet changing needs.
Chick-fil-A, for example, implemented a "Safe Service" model, which included enhanced cleaning protocols, contactless payment, and drive-thru and curbside pickup options. KFC also focused on drive-thru and delivery, partnering with companies like Grubhub and DoorDash to expand its reach.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, some competitors saw an opportunity to gain market share. Popeyes, in particular, benefited from the viral success of its chicken sandwich, which helped drive sales even during the height of the pandemic. The company reported a 24.8% increase in same-store sales in the third quarter of 2020, outperforming many of its competitors.
The Role of Social Media and Digital Marketing
In today‘s fast-food landscape, social media and digital marketing play a crucial role in shaping brand perception and customer engagement. Competitors that successfully leverage these channels can gain a significant advantage in the market.
Wendy‘s, for example, has gained a reputation for its witty and engaging social media presence, particularly on Twitter. The company‘s snarky tweets and playful jabs at competitors have helped it build a loyal following and generate buzz around its brand.
Chick-fil-A has also leveraged social media to connect with customers and promote its brand values. The company‘s Facebook page features a mix of promotional content, community engagement, and inspirational stories, helping to reinforce its family-friendly image.
Popeyes, meanwhile, has used social media to fuel the hype around its chicken sandwich, with campaigns like the "Chicken Wars" and the "Bring Your Own Bun" promotion. These efforts have helped generate massive amounts of user-generated content and word-of-mouth buzz, driving sales and brand awareness.
The Potential Impact of Emerging Competitors
While established players like KFC, Chick-fil-A, and Popeyes dominate the fast-food fried chicken market, emerging competitors could potentially disrupt the landscape in the coming years.
One such competitor is Dave‘s Hot Chicken, a rapidly growing chain that specializes in Nashville-style hot chicken. Founded in 2017, the company has already expanded to over 40 locations across the US, with plans for further growth. Dave‘s Hot Chicken differentiates itself through its focus on spice levels and its celebrity investor backing, which includes Drake and Samuel L. Jackson.
Another potential disruptor is the rise of ghost kitchens and virtual brands. These delivery-only concepts allow established chains and new entrants to test new menu items and reach customers without the overhead of physical restaurants. KFC, for example, has launched a virtual brand called "KFC Chicken Sandwich," which is available exclusively through delivery apps like Uber Eats and Grubhub.
The Future of the Fast-Food Fried Chicken Market
As the fast-food fried chicken market continues to evolve, several trends and developments could shape the competitive landscape in the coming years:
1. Plant-Based Alternatives
The growing popularity of plant-based meat alternatives, such as those offered by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, may push fried chicken chains to introduce more vegetarian and vegan options. KFC, for example, has tested plant-based chicken in select markets, while Burger King has introduced the Impossible Whopper nationwide.
2. Technology Integration
The increasing use of mobile ordering, delivery services, and AI-powered personalization could change how customers interact with fast-food chains. Competitors that successfully leverage technology may gain an edge in the market. Chick-fil-A, for instance, has invested heavily in its mobile app and loyalty program, which has helped drive sales and customer engagement.
3. International Expansion
As the US market becomes saturated, fast-food fried chicken chains may look to expand internationally to drive growth. Popeyes, for example, has plans to open hundreds of new restaurants in China and other countries in the coming years. KFC, meanwhile, already has a significant global presence, with over 22,000 locations worldwide.
4. Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility
As consumers become more conscious of the environmental and social impact of their food choices, fast-food chains may need to prioritize sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiatives to remain competitive. Chick-fil-A, for example, has committed to using 100% cage-free eggs and has invested in renewable energy projects. Popeyes has also made efforts to reduce its environmental footprint, such as by using sustainable packaging materials.
Conclusion
The fast-food fried chicken market is a dynamic and fiercely competitive space, with established players and new entrants constantly jockeying for position. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. faces significant challenges in maintaining its market share against formidable competitors like KFC, Chick-fil-A, and a host of regional chains.
To stay ahead, Popeyes must continue to innovate its menu, deliver exceptional customer experiences, and adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. By leveraging its unique brand identity, Cajun-inspired flavors, and the success of its fried chicken sandwich, Popeyes has the potential to not only defend its position but also to grow its market share in the years to come.
However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. As the market evolves and new trends emerge, Popeyes will need to be agile, strategic, and customer-focused to thrive in this highly competitive landscape. By staying true to its roots while embracing change, Popeyes can continue to be a major player in the fast-food fried chicken market for years to come.

Market Share Comparison
Popeyes has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, solidifying its position in the competitive fast-food industry. As of October 2023, Popeyes surpassed KFC to become the second-largest chicken chain in the United States, according to Hypebeast. This achievement highlights the brand’s ability to resonate with consumers and meet their cravings for high-quality chicken offerings.
In terms of domestic locations, Popeyes operates an extensive network of restaurants across the United States. As of October 2023, the brand boasted 3,579 locations nationwide, further cementing its presence in the market.
Popeyes’ success is also reflected in its sales performance. In 2023, the brand recorded sales of $6.3 billion in the United States, showcasing significant growth compared to the previous year (Hypebeast).

Between 2019 and 2021, Popeyes increased its market share in the chicken sandwich category from 10.3% to 25.1%, surpassing competitors such as Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s during the same period (QSR Magazine). This growth in market share demonstrates Popeyes’ ability to captivate consumers with its delectable offerings.

To learn more about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing Popeyes, continue reading the respective sections of this article.
Strengths of Popeyes
Popeyes, a renowned fast-food chain, possesses several strengths that have contributed to its continued success and growing market share. These strengths include a strong brand identity, effective social media marketing, innovative advertising techniques, and continuous product innovation.
Strong Brand Identity
Popeyes has established a strong brand identity that resonates with consumers worldwide. The brand’s authenticity, commitment to quality ingredients, rich history, consistent messaging, and community engagement have played vital roles in shaping its identity and attracting loyal customers. Popeyes’ distinct Louisiana-inspired flavors and unique menu offerings set it apart from competitors, creating a niche in the fast-food industry.

By creating a strong online presence and cultivating a loyal community of brand advocates, Popeyes has been able to drive traffic, boost sales, and solidify its position as a leader in the fast-food industry. The brand’s strategic viral marketing tactics, visually appealing content, storytelling, engaging hashtags, and user-generated content have all contributed to its success in the digital realm (Brand Credential).
Innovative Advertising Techniques
Popeyes stands out in the fast-food industry due to its innovative advertising techniques. The brand effectively utilizes humor, pop culture references, storytelling, celebrity endorsements, social media, experiential marketing, and customer engagement to capture and retain consumers’ attention. These advertising strategies have not only boosted brand awareness but also translated into increased sales and market share (Brand Credential).

Continuous product innovation has been a key driver of Popeyes’ success. The brand regularly introduces limited-time offers and new products, enticing customers with exciting menu options. These innovative strategies generate hype, attract new customers, and keep existing patrons coming back for more. Popeyes’ ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and introduce new and enticing menu items has contributed to its strong market position and customer loyalty (Brand Credential).
Popeyes’ strengths in brand identity, social media marketing, advertising techniques, and product innovation have been crucial in driving sales growth, revenue outperformance, and market share expansion. The brand’s commitment to delivering authentic flavors, engaging with customers through various channels, and consistently introducing new and exciting menu items has solidified its position as a formidable player in the fast-food industry.
Weaknesses of Popeyes
Despite its strong market presence, Popeyes also faces certain weaknesses that can impact its performance in the fast-food industry. These weaknesses include its limited global presence, competition with KFC, and a sales decline in 2021.
Limited Global Presence
One of the weaknesses of Popeyes is its limited global presence compared to some of its competitors. While Popeyes has a significant presence in North America, it has a relatively smaller footprint in other regions around the world. This limited global presence limits the brand’s exposure to international markets and potentially hampers its ability to compete on a global scale.
Competition with KFC
Popeyes faces intense competition from various fast-food chains, and one of its primary competitors is KFC. Both Popeyes and KFC operate within the same segment of the industry, offering fried chicken and other menu items. The competition between these two brands can pose challenges for Popeyes in terms of market share and customer loyalty. In order to stay competitive, Popeyes must continuously differentiate itself from KFC and other competitors through its unique offerings, marketing strategies, and customer experience.
Sales Decline in 2021
In 2021, Popeyes experienced a decline in sales, which has been attributed to fierce competition in the chicken sandwich market, particularly with rival chain Chick-fil-A (WATTAgNet). This decline in sales can be seen as a weakness for Popeyes, as it indicates challenges in maintaining its market position and meeting consumer demands. Factors such as intense competition, changing consumer preferences, and supply chain disruptions have contributed to this decline (WATTAgNet).
Despite these weaknesses, Popeyes continues to be a significant player in the fast-food industry. It is important for the company to address these weaknesses and leverage its competitive advantages to overcome challenges and maintain its market share. Additionally, exploring franchise opportunities and implementing effective business strategies can help Popeyes expand its reach and improve its performance in the global market.
Opportunities for Popeyes

Popeyes has experienced significant growth in the chicken sandwich market, surpassing competitors such as Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s to become a major player in this category. According to QSR Magazine, Popeyes increased its market share in the chicken sandwich category from 10.3% to 25.1% between 2019 and 2021.

Expanding the franchise network allows Popeyes to leverage the local knowledge and expertise of franchisees, helping to adapt the brand to different regional preferences and cultural nuances. This localized approach can help Popeyes establish a stronger foothold in new markets and drive further growth.
Additionally, expanding the franchise network can also help Popeyes capitalize on economies of scale, reduce operational costs, and increase brand visibility through a wider network of locations. By strategically selecting franchise partners and providing strong support and training, Popeyes can ensure consistent brand standards and a seamless customer experience across its franchise locations.

Overall, Popeyes has several opportunities to further strengthen its market position and continue its upward trajectory. By focusing on the growth in the chicken sandwich market, expanding its franchise network, and increasing market share through strategic business strategies, Popeyes can continue to thrive in the highly competitive fast-food industry.
Threats to Popeyes
While Popeyes has experienced significant success and growth in the fast-food industry, it also faces certain threats that can impact its market share and overall performance. These threats include intense competition in the fast-food industry and supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
Intense Competition in the Fast-Food Industry
Popeyes operates in a highly competitive landscape within the fast-food industry. One of its main competitors is KFC, a long-standing and well-established brand in the chicken segment. The competition between Popeyes and KFC is fierce, with Popeyes consistently growing its market presence and challenging KFC’s dominance in the fast-food chicken industry.
Furthermore, the chicken sandwich market has become a battleground for fast-food chains. Popeyes experienced a decline in sales in 2021, which has been attributed to fierce competition in the chicken sandwich market, particularly with rival chain Chick-fil-A. Despite the sales decrease, Popeyes still retains a significant market share in the chicken fast-food industry, indicating its strong presence and competitiveness in the market (WATTAgNet).
Supply Chain Disruptions and Labor Shortages
In recent times, Popeyes has faced challenges related to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. These factors can significantly impact the overall performance of the fast-food chain. Supply chain disruptions can lead to delays in the delivery of essential ingredients and products, affecting the availability and quality of menu items.
Additionally, labor shortages can pose challenges in maintaining efficient operations and providing quality service to customers. A shortage of skilled and trained staff can result in longer wait times, decreased customer satisfaction, and potential sales decline. Popeyes’ sales decrease in 2021 has been linked to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, highlighting the impact of these threats on the overall performance of the brand (WATTAgNet).
To mitigate these threats, Popeyes needs to continually adapt its strategies and operations. This may involve implementing efficient supply chain management practices, exploring alternative sourcing options, and investing in employee recruitment and training programs. By addressing these challenges proactively, Popeyes can better position itself to maintain its market share and continue its growth trajectory in the fast-food industry.
Future Outlook for Popeyes
Strategies to Maintain Market Share
Popeyes has experienced significant growth in recent years, particularly in the chicken sandwich market. As of 2021, Popeyes increased its market share in the chicken sandwich category from 10.3% to 25.1%, surpassing competitors such as Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s during the same period (QSR Magazine). To maintain its market share and continue its success, Popeyes can employ several strategies:
Continued emphasis on product innovation: Popeyes’ success can be attributed to its ability to resonate with consumers through innovative and appealing products. By continuously introducing new and exciting menu items, Popeyes can keep customers engaged and attract new clientele. This strategy allows Popeyes to stay ahead of the competition and maintain its market share.
Investment in marketing and advertising: Popeyes’ effective use of humor, pop culture references, storytelling, celebrity endorsements, social media engagement, and experiential marketing has played a significant role in capturing and retaining consumers’ attention. By investing in creative and engaging marketing campaigns, Popeyes can continue to strengthen its brand presence and attract a loyal customer base (Brand Credential).
Focus on customer experience: Providing exceptional customer service and creating a memorable dining experience are essential for maintaining customer loyalty. Popeyes should continue to prioritize customer satisfaction by training its staff to deliver excellent service, ensuring cleanliness and efficiency in its restaurants, and actively listening to and addressing customer feedback.
Expansion of the franchise network: Popeyes can capitalize on its success by expanding its franchise network. Offering franchise opportunities allows Popeyes to penetrate new markets and increase its presence nationwide and globally. This expansion strategy can help Popeyes gain a larger market share and solidify its position as a leading fast-food chain.
The Competitive Landscape in the Chicken Sandwich Market
While Popeyes has made significant strides in the chicken sandwich market, the competition remains intense. Chick-fil-A continues to hold its top position, with a 33.3% share of the market, surpassing Popeyes and KFC. As the popularity of chicken sandwiches continues to grow, other fast-food chains are also vying for a larger share of this lucrative segment.
To navigate the competitive landscape, Popeyes needs to stay ahead of emerging trends and consumer preferences. This includes continuous research and development efforts to refine its chicken sandwich offerings and introduce new variations to cater to diverse tastes. By monitoring market trends and consumer demands, Popeyes can adapt its menu and marketing strategies to maintain its competitiveness within the chicken sandwich market.
Furthermore, Popeyes should continue to leverage its competitive advantages such as its strong brand identity, effective social media marketing, and innovative advertising techniques. These strengths contribute to Popeyes’ ability to capture and retain customers in a highly competitive market.
In conclusion, Popeyes has a promising future ahead, with opportunities to maintain and expand its market share. By implementing strategies focused on product innovation, marketing, customer experience, and franchise expansion, Popeyes can continue its upward trajectory. Additionally, by closely monitoring the competitive landscape in the chicken sandwich market and adapting to evolving consumer preferences, Popeyes can remain a key player in the industry.

Popeyes SWOT Analysis: Opportunities Management Has Missed
By Brett Lindenberg|November 2nd, 2022|SWOT|Comments Off
on Popeyes SWOT Analysis: Opportunities Management Has Missed
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc., also known as Popeyes, is an American chain of fried chicken fast-food restaurants that was founded by Alvin C. Copeland Sr. in New Orleans in 1972. What started with one small restaurant has now swept the United States and the rest of the world with its sensational taste from the company’s 3,400 locations worldwide.
But it wasn’t a smooth sailing ride right from the beginning. Founder Copeland actually started with a donut business but decided to shift to fast-food chicken when KFC first opened its store in New Orleans. Originally, Copeland named his chicken venture “Chicken on the run” but had to close it down when it wasn’t generating enough sales and attracting customers at all. Later on, he re-opened the business along with a new recipe by adding a unique blend of spices to the mixture.
Today, Popeyes has stood its ground as a reputable and well-loved fried chicken fast-food chain, boasting $143 million revenue in the third quarter of 2021, up by 1.2% from the prior-year quarter.
To answer the question, ‘Popeyes VS KFC: Who’s winning?’, let’s take a look at Popeyes SWOT analysis and see where the brand is lacking and has helped the company gain market share over the last 24 months. I also share my ideas on what management can do to improve business performance even further.

Popeyes VS KFC
Strengths
Popeyes is known for fried chicken.
Building the brand to where it is today is no easy feat. But what makes Popeyes one of the famous fried chicken fast-food chains not just in the US but in the rest of the world is the company’s consistency in offering quality products and services to its customers.
Product quality and innovation – Fast-food chains often compromise quality to ensure faster service but not Popeyes that prioritizes quality over everything else. This is evident in their meal prep process as they marinate chicken for 12 hours with a unique blend of seasonings. The same can be said with the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich that resulted in long lines and sold out inventories.
Global expansion – Popeyes knows the path to growth is through expansion. After opening stores in Brazil, Spain, and other countries in Europe and South America, Popeyes opened its flagship store in Shanghai, China, at the height of the global health crisis.
Their China debut marked their most successful grand opening yet as customers waited outside in line to get a hold of their chicken and chicken sandwich. They plan to open over 1,500 restaurants in China over the next decade.
Digital focus on the mobile app and delivery channels – To cater to the younger customers and continue the brand’s innovation, Popeyes launched its first loyalty program called Popeyes Rewards. The program aims to drive more customers by offering exclusive deals and a chance to earn and redeem points using the Popeyes app.
Since the launch of the app, the company’s digital sales accounted for 17% of the total sales in the US in the first quarter of 2021. Starting 2018, Popeyes offers delivery through Uber Eats which reported that orders for fried chicken increased by 54% over the past year.
Weaknesses
Whether you live in the East or West… Everyone loves fried chicken.
While it might feel like Popeyes is firing on all cylinders there are some exposed flanks.
Weak online presence on social media – In this day and age, having a social media presence is very important for any business. With Popeyes, they haven’t gotten the hang of it just yet. With less than a million followers on Facebook as compared to over 57 million KFC followers, we know pretty well Popeyes isn’t doing much in the digital world. The same is true with their Twitter account with just over 250,000 followers while KFC has 1.5 million of its own.
Franchises are mostly at gas stations – Considering Popeyes is not a startup company, you would expect more than having franchises that are mostly at gas stations. Not only does this mean there is less customer traffic but also the fact that there aren’t enough customers who are willing to buy and dine at proper store locations. This can also paint a negative impression of the brand given that it’s been around for years yet we are seeing that franchises don’t seem to be doing as well as they could be.

Store locations are highly concentrated in the South – Given the restaurant chain originated in the South, analysts notice how most of Popeyes store locations are highly concentrated in the South area (Tennessee and Louisiana). The company still has a lot of work ahead of them to win over customers in the Midwest.
Bad customer service – They may have focused too much on product quality and have made a name off it, but Popeyes needs to get their act together when it comes to their customer service. Back in 2016, Popeyes finally admitted their customer service sucks. This admission came after constant complaints on social media from very dissatisfied customers.
Limited menu variety – While Popeyes’ chicken sandwich made a huge impact on customers and became the fast-food phenomenon in 2019 as it continues to do until today there have been a lot of complaints regarding the brand’s lack of other food offerings. Further menu innovation and exploration is advised for this restaurant.
Opportunities
Could deep fried chicken strips be an opportunity for this chain?
Popeyes has the potential to grow further and expand deeper into different markets.
Introduce a healthy menu options – According to the International Food Information Council’s survey, 85% of Americans have changed their diet or the way they prepare their meals during the pandemic. For a fast-food chain like Popeyes, one way they can attract more customers is by introducing a handful of healthy menu items.
Use Popeye the sailor man to enhance the brand image – Popeye the sailor man is a fictional character that made its debut in the daily King Features comic strip called Thimble Theatre on January 17, 1929, which later on also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons. Given Popeye’s popularity and having the same name as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, it would give the fast-food chain a boost in their brand image if they used Popeye the sailor man as part of their branding and marketing efforts.
Entry into the emerging Asian markets – As an American brand, it’s not always easy to expand internationally where taste preferences and eating habits can be very different. But this doesn’t mean one shouldn’t even try to make a move. After Popeyes’ successful launch in China, the company should try to further deepen its footprint and continue opening its stores in more Asian markets such as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. 
Threats
It’s smart for businesses to understand the threat to their business model. This helps management prepare for changes in market dynamics.
Rising cost of ingredients – If there was one consistent threat that always hit restaurants, it is the rising cost of ingredients. Restaurant owners have accepted the fact that there will always be a rise in the cost of ingredients but with the pandemic hitting hard and caused a variety of supply chain issues, even big fast-food chains like Popeyes are facing a difficult time dealing with it. The only way out is if Popeyes can either cut costs or pass those expenses onto the customer through menu price increases.

Highly competitive industry – With over 200,000 fast-food restaurants in the US, saying that the competition in this industry is tough is an understatement. Plus the fact that Popeyes’ direct competition includes KFC, McDonald’s and Burger King – some of the country’s leading global fast-food chains. Consistency in product quality and service should remain as Popeyes’ main priority if they want to continue swimming forward and not just treading water.
Rising health conscious individuals – Obesity has long been considered a major health issue in America where 42.5% of adults aged 20 and over are suffering from obesity. This opened the eyes of many individuals who are starting to rethink the fuel they put into their bodies. As a popular fast-food chain, it would be difficult for Popeyes to keep attracting customers if a big percentage of their target audience are starting to eat healthy or are health conscious.
Popeyes VS KFC: Who is winning?
What chicken restaurant do you prefer?
Now that we’ve taken a look at Popeyes’s SWOT analysis, let’s go back to the question of who is winning between Popeyes and KFC? With both fast-food chains being two of the country’s well-loved in the industry and each having their own share of dedicated fans through the years, it might be difficult to know who exactly is winning without looking at the cold hard numbers.
In terms of the number of store locations, it’s a landslide win with KFC’s 3,984 locations in the US only, plus 5,200 stores in China versus Popeyes’ 3,400 locations worldwide. Given that KFC has more locations in the country and worldwide, one can assume that KFC would generate more revenue than Popeyes. So how much is it exactly?
It is reported that in 2020, KFC was valued at $5.4 billion while Popeyes’ revenue in the 3rd quarter of 2021 is $143 million, up 1.2% from the previous year.
Now, let’s talk about the most important thing – the food. Both Popeyes and KFC serve similar products like fried chicken, chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, biscuits and more. But who has better food? Is KFC winning with their years of experience and proven secret blend of herbs? Or is Popeyes on the lead with their extra crunchy, mild and spicy chicken offerings?
Related Reading: SWOT Analysis for Red Bull: The Overlooked Threat of this Energy Drink
Fans say that Popeyes is winning when it comes to crunch and it leveled up even more thanks to KFC chicken’s dryness. Some people also shared that when it comes to slides, Popeyes is on the lead. But I think that when it comes to taste, it is pretty much personal preference as one would debate KFC has better food if they don’t really like the Cajun approach from Popeyes or vice versa, someone saying that Popeyes has leveled up the fried chicken approach with their extra crisp and flavor.
I think we can all agree that the debate between the best fried chicken chain will continue to rage on for the foreseeable future. One thing is for sure, Popeyes still has plenty of growth potential.
Having seven times less store locations as KFC but gaining over $100 million in revenue last year, Popeyes clearly knows what they’re doing and if they focus on improving their customer service which has been highly criticized for years. The chicken chain seems poised to make a fortune in the years, especially if they can replicate the release of their now famous chicken sandwich that took American’s taste buds by storm in 2019.

Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A: how they really measure up
Popeyes may be trolling Chick-fil-A on Twitter, but the latter has the former where it counts: in the numbers

What's better than a fried-chicken Twitter battle on a Monday?
Stick with us.
After Popeyes ($QSR) added a new chicken sandwich to its menu, Chick-fil-A ($PRIVATE:PRIV_CHICKFILA) tweeted earlier today that its iteration of the fried chicken sandwich was "the original". It did so without mentioning Popeyes by name which, in the Twitterverse, is called a "subtweet", which, in the Twitterverse, is a questionable move. Understandably, Chick-fil-A has a bit of a swagger right now, as it's considered by many to be the fastest growing fast food chain.
But Popeyes wasn't having any of that, so it responded with "... y'all good?" in a clear taunt and recognition of the sub-tweet.
The response lit up Twitter with over 70,000 likes and 26,000 retweets so far. Sadly, for Chick-fil-A at least, its original tweet has only seen 2,000 likes and 373 retweets, in what is being seen as a social-media rally in favor of Popeyes.
First, a little level setting here. Chick-fil-A far outpaces Popeyes when it comes to Twitter followers, by a factor of 9.6 to 1. Which makes what happened even more surprising.
But other data points to clear wins for Popeyes. Popeyes isn't just beating Chick-fil-A in retweets today. Its global store count outpaces that of Chick-fil-A.
Popeyes has a solid presence not just in the United States, but also in South America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (it's also huge in South Korea).
The number of Popeyes locations throughout the world tops 4,000, with 3,000 of those in the United States alone. Its revenue in 2016 was $269 million. In 2018, it was bought out by Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (it also owns Tim Hortons), which reported 2018 revenues totaling $5.4 billion.
Popeyes restaurant foot traffic, as measured by Facebook ($FB) "Were Here" count, is healthy. It's grown to 1.12 million and looks on pace to continue to grow in popularity. But before you give Popeyes the social media edge, see below.
Chick-fil-A isn't too far behind with more than 2,300 locations throughout The United States and Canada. Meanwhile, its revenue in 2018 was $10.5 billion - almost twice that of Popeyes plus its siblings under RBI.
Chick-fil-A's "Were Here" count is closing in on a massive 8 million — that's 8 million selfies, check-ins, and Facebook status updates from Chick-fil-A's 2,300 locations. That far outpaces Popeye's count.
So who wins? Only one way to find out: see you at lunch tomorrow.

The many, many conversations about fried chicken sandwiches, explained
On Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A vs. our collective sanity.
by Rachel Sugar
Aug 28, 2019, 1:40 PM EDT
Jacqueline Day for Vox
It is official: Popeyes is out of the Sandwich. The chicken wells have run dry.
“Popeyes aggressively forecasted demand through the end of September and has already sold through that inventory,” a release from the company explains. “As a result, Popeyes restaurants across the country are expected to sell out of the Chicken Sandwich by the end of this week. We, along with our suppliers, are working tirelessly to bring the new sandwich back to guests as soon as possible.”
It is the logical endpoint of the recent fried chicken frenzy. If you have, for some reason, missed it, distracted by things that are not chicken sandwiches, here is what happened. On August 12, Popeyes, a beloved Louisiana fried chicken chain now headquartered in Miami, debuted its new fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich features a slab of crunchy fried chicken breast on brioche with pickles and mayonnaise. It comes in two varieties: The mayonnaise can be either spicy or not. Does this sound reminiscent of another chicken sandwich you know? Correct.
A week passed, and mostly, the world went on. And then on Monday, Chick-fil-A — America’s favorite restaurant, according to the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, for the fourth year in a row, despite its controversial political history — wrote a tweet. The tweet said: “Bun+Chicken+Pickles = all the [heart] for the original.” It did not mention Popeyes. It was just listing the ingredients of the chain’s core chicken sandwich. It was just saying — apropos of nothing! — that it had come first.
Chicken sandwich enthusiasts on Twitter were quick to take notice, and within a few hours, Popeyes — or rather, the advertising agency GSD&M, which oversees the chain’s social media strategy — fired back with its pièce de résistance: a quote tweet, plus a low-key expression of concern: “… y’all good?” it asked.
With that, the war was on, and everyone from passionate lay chicken enthusiasts to chicken professionals was weighing in. The conversation on Twitter, fueled by Black Twitter in particular, clustered around the hashtags #ChickenWars, and #ChickenSandwichWars, and the less combative, more descriptive #ChickenSandwichTwitter. Apex Marketing Group, an advertising consultancy in Michigan, released a report estimating that Popeyes received $23.25 million in free advertising, according to Reuters.
On Twitter and in the burgeoning chicken sandwich literature, the arguments generally break down like this. First, there are the flavor arguments, which examine the sandwiches on their comparative sandwich-related merits. Popeyes tastes better; Chick-fil-A tastes better; or the slightly more nuanced variation: Popeyes is better because I can now eat a delicious fast food chicken sandwich without supporting the politics of Chick-fil-A.
Still others pointed out that, despite the promise of Popeyes, there is no such thing as a morally pure fried chicken fast food sandwich. Fast food is built on factory farms and inhumane labor practices — poultry processing, heavily reliant on immigrant workers, is among the “lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs in the country,” and working conditions at the fast food restaurants themselves are notoriously grim. Which, of course, we all kind of know: A sandwich that costs $3.99 is almost certainly the product of some exploitation.
The latest dispatches from the front lines seem only to confirm the point, and highlight it in neon. Reports say some Popeyes employees have been working “more than 60-hour weeks” to keep up with overwhelming demand. “Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad,” one crew member in Orange County told Business Insider. “I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out,” a manager on the East Coast said.
(A fifth group, for a time, was other brands, including Wendy’s, which sells noted chicken sandwiches, and Yelp, which sells no sandwiches at all, attempting to break into the chicken discourse with their own hyped-up promotion.)
(Then a sixth discourse emerged, with some high-profile people — Judge Joe Brown and Janelle Monáe among them — suggesting African Americans cared more about standing in line for chicken sandwiches than voting or self-empowerment. This idea, which seemed to play into racist tropes, was not well received. Others were quick to point out that African Americans do wait in line to vote; that the problem is voter suppression; and that it really shouldn’t be easier to buy a hyped-up sandwich than to vote, and yet it often is. Monáe apologized.)
This is all to say that there is almost no discussion about life in America that cannot be had through chicken sandwiches. “People want chicken to do this heavy lifting that they’re not themselves willing to do,” says Psyche Williams-Forson, chair of American studies at the University of Maryland and the author of Building Houses Out of Chicken Legs, a study of the roles, both literal and symbolic, that chicken has played in some African American women’s lives. The story of the #ChickenWars is a story about brand identity. It is a story of human identity. It is a story about chicken.
Fast food chicken sandwiches are a point of personal pride, with a complicated history
It is hard to imagine two brands better positioned for a high-profile battle. Chick-fil-A is a fast food chicken pioneer. But it did not, contrary to its claims, invent the very concept of the fried chicken sandwich in the early 1960s — a history that erases the culinary legacy of African Americans. At Ebony, food journalist Donna Battle Pierce, searching black newspaper archives, traces the fried chicken sandwich back to at least 1936.
“[Chick-fil-A] invented, maybe, a modern take on the chicken sandwich,” says Williams-Forson. “They invented this new way of marketing a chicken sandwich. But when folks laid down at night back in the day and they wanted a late-night snack, and there [was] a loaf of bread, and some meat that was left over from dinner or supper, they put those pieces of food together, and while they may not have said, ‘this is the chicken sandwich!’ in fact that’s what it was.”
Like the history of fried chicken itself (and like most food histories), the origins of the fried chicken sandwich are hard to definitively trace. “When we start talking about origins, I think we run into a lot of different problems,” Williams-Forson says, because “foods travel, animals travel, spices travel.” Fried chicken has Scottish and African origins, and the version we know today builds on both.
There is almost no discussion about life in America that cannot be had through chicken sandwiches
So Chick-fil-A did not “invent” the chicken sandwich. At the same time, though, the brand’s impact on the chicken sandwich is undeniable. As most of the industry struggles, Chick-fil-A keeps growing, and this June, officially assumed its place as the third-largest restaurant chain in the US, up from the seventh.
In the world of fried chicken franchises, according to a July industry report from IBISWorld, the chain has 27.9 percent of chicken market share, more than any other single band. This is despite the chain’s continued history of making donations to anti-LGBTQ causes, ThinkProgress notes, and the company’s refusal to include sexual orientation and gender identification in its employment nondiscrimination policy. Chick-fil-A may be the incumbent chicken champ, but there is room for an insurgent.
In this case, the insurgent is Popeyes. Per IBISWorld, Popeyes has less than half of Chick-fil-A’s market share, with 10.1 percent, but its chicken is beloved, not just by regular fast food diners but also by critics and highbrow chefs. “Popeyes fried chicken is fantastic,” wrote chicken poet and New Yorker food correspondent Helen Rosner. “The meat is flavorful and juicy, encased in a spiky, golden sea urchin of batter — surprisingly light, uncommonly crispy.” Chef Wylie Dufresne, who is known for popularizing molecular gastronomy — molecular gastronomy! — served Popeyes at his wedding, because, as he told First We Feast, it’s “just the most delicious chicken.”
Popeyes and Chick-fil-A both sell chicken to lots of groups of people. But as Williams-Forson observes, there is — at least in perception — a kind of racial affiliation, As the narrative goes, she says, “Popeyes equals black, and Chick-fil-A equals non-black, which is kind of interesting to me,” and she isn’t alone.
“I have no scientific basis for saying this, but I think Popeyes has more brand loyalty with African Americans because there seem to be more outlets in black neighborhoods, the spicy IS spicy, and the food is cheaper,” soul food scholar Adrian Miller told me. “I don’t really see Chick-fil-A in black neighborhoods.” A 2013 Washington Post article chalks this up to strategy: “Traditionally, Popeyes has been focused on the ‘urban’ market, which in retail parlance can be code for ‘black.’”
Popeyes underwent a corporate makeover in the late 2000s, which included tweaking the name “Popeyes Chicken ’n Biscuits” to the more locavorian “Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,” along with a push to expand into “the suburbs.” And yet, despite the revamp, part of the delight of Popeyes is in how it hasn’t changed: “What I like most about Popeyes,” writes poet and critic Hanif Abdurraqib at Medium, “is that the space demands you to come exactly as you are. There’s a type of equality leveled at a patron ... within the walls of Popeyes, no one is too good or too educated to not be treated like a burden for someone behind the counter.”
By contrast, Abdurraqib writes that he finds Chick-fil-A, despite its politics, or perhaps because of them, “a bit too sanitized for my liking.” Chick-fil-A, maybe, does not want you to come exactly as you are, but the bathrooms are the cleanest in the industry.
Until recently, Popeyes, like almost every other player in the industry, had failed to produce a god-level chicken sandwich. Last year, McDonald’s introduced a fancy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich, and the world mostly stayed calm. McDonald’s is not a fried chicken leader. Popeyes, on the other hand, was uniquely positioned to ruffle feathers for one simple reason: It is threateningly good.
That the fight exists at all is a testament to the rising tides of the fast food chicken sandwich
As a general category, chicken has been on the rise since the early 1980s. In 1977, the McGovern Senate report laid out a first set of dietary guidelines, which “created serious shock waves about the perils of red meat,” says Adam Chandler, author of Drive-Thru Dreams, about the American history of fast food. Chicken could be the answer. Heavily processed fast food chicken wasn’t actually healthy, but it exuded a health-adjacent glow, because it is not beef.
A 1984 New York Times article chronicled the boom, noting that chicken had become “the fastest-growing segment of the fast-food industry.” People were eating more chicken than ever, because it was “cheaper and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, and market studies indicate that women prefer chicken,” which is a statement we must unpack another time.
But while McNuggets flourished as soon as they were introduced, in 1981, the fast food fried chicken sandwich has been tougher to perfect. It is always further in the distance, just inches out of reach. McDonald’s introduced the first McChicken sandwich in 1980, then abandoned it, and then brought it back, and has flip-flopped ever since.
In an age of drive-thrus, a sandwich is practical in a way a bucket isn’t: You can eat it while you drive. In 2005, McDonald’s debuted an attempted Chick-fil-A competitor, the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich, but pulled it in 2015. Burger King had a megahit in 1990 with the broiled-not-fried BK Broiler, but it lost momentum two years later and has been cycling through new iterations ever since. Wendy’s has a fried chicken sandwich, and so does Arby’s, and so, too, does White Castle, which was news to me.
Yet the goal remains. Shoot for the moon, the saying goes; even if you miss, you’ll end up with a fried chicken sandwich.
The chicken fight is not over yet
“The fastest-growing food over the last 10 years in the restaurant industry has been fried chicken sandwiches,” one analyst told the New York Times in 2008. A decade later, the quest still marches on. In 2016, Bon Appétit announced that we had reached “peak fried chicken sandwich mania,” citing Shake Shack’s much-buzzed-over entry into the category, the Chick’n Shack, as evidence.
The data backed it up: Between 2011 and 2016, chicken sales at quick-service and fast-casual restaurants catapulted 42.1 percent, according to the market research firm Euromonitor International. Chicken chains were thriving, and non-chicken chains were doubling down on extra chicken offerings: It was, let us never forget, the era of Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa, which used a blanket of fried chicken where the tortilla was supposed to go.
The reasons for the increasing chicken mania are more or less the same as they ever were. Chicken is still cheaper than beef. It still seems healthy in a way that beef does not — not just for you personally, but for the environment, because, again, it is not beef. It is novel, compared to the crushing hegemony of burgers. And it is trendy.
Shoot for the moon, the saying goes; even if you miss, you’ll end up with a fried chicken sandwich
The past two decades, Miller says, have seen an increasing interest in regional American cooking, and one of “the most dynamic and popular regions is the American South,” and so of course there’s massive interest in fried chicken. For high-end chefs, the chicken sandwich has become a kind of test, a blank canvas on which to display their culinary chops. In 2015, both David Chang (at Fuku) and Danny Meyer (at Shake Shack) debut their high-end fast-casual fried chicken sandwich iterations.
This is great because fried chicken is delicious, but, as Osayi Endolyn writes in an essay on fried chicken for the book You and I Eat the Same, that catapulting trendiness is “where things can get tricky.” Enslaved people were known for selling chicken as far back as Mount Vernon — this is the beginning of the long and fraught relationship between African Americans and chicken — and after emancipation, newly free black women, known as “waiter carriers,” began cooking and selling fried chicken to travelers at pretty much every train stop in the South, one of many, many historically uncredited but increasingly appreciated contributions African and African American cooks have made to what we now consider Southern food.
But when you look at who gets famous — and rich — things get dicey. “There is a distinct pattern in the United States, wherein African American chefs struggle to find parity with their white counterparts in terms of recognition, funding, and reward,” Endolyn writes. “Both codified and unspoken social policies ensured that the black women who worked as waiter carriers in the nineteenth century never saw their business become a global franchise.”
Even now, when it comes to chicken, the big players (Chick-fil-A and Popeyes among them) have white founders and white CEOs. When the #ChickenWars broke out — again, driven largely by the enthusiasm of Black Twitter — it wasn’t lost on the participants who was doing the work, and who was getting paid.
So who, ultimately, wins the #ChickenSandwichWar?
If Chick-fil-A is the reigning king of the chicken sandwich, the pressure is on to usurp the throne. McDonald’s US franchisees have been urging the company to develop a chicken sandwich to rival Chick-fil-A’s, what the defunct Southern Style could have been but wasn’t. “Chick-fil-A’s results demonstrate the power of chicken,” the National Owners Association board wrote in an email to fellow operators last month, just. “Chick-fil-A invented the Chicken Sandwich, but we can do one better.” Can they, though? It is unclear. Can Popeyes? By most accounts, they can.
And yet the counterintuitive beauty of a fast food Twitter dispute is that there are no losers. Fast food chains have harnessed the power of Twitter the way almost no other industry has. Though it contains multitudes, fast food brand Twitter tends to be absurd, or whimsical, or vaguely embarrassing; it is pop-culture obsessed and sometimes ill-advised. It is in on the somewhat uncomfortable joke, which is that brands are not people, even if they pretend to act like them. At the same time, though, fast food brands are so ingrained in American culture that we do, sort of, have emotional, humanoid relationships with them.
Chick-fil-A made an overture, and Popeyes responded — “we saw a major boost in organic conversations about the excellent quality of our sandwich and we felt it made sense to jump in and participate,” a spokesperson told me — and the result was that for a few brief hours, everyone was talking about chicken all the time. “Because taste and fandom are subjective,” says Chandler, “everyone wins in a fast food social media war.”

Chicken sandwich competition takes a bite out of Popeyes
But the chain’s sales improved last quarter and it remains in a much stronger position than it was three years ago.

It turns out that, when a bunch of your competitors introduce a product just like yours, it can have an influence on sales.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen received a lesson in this last year. The chicken chain introduced its new chicken sandwich permanently in November 2019, generated the strongest quarterly same-store sales in modern industry history and then largely kept sales strong even through the pandemic.
But those sales slowed last year. U.S. same-store sales declined 2% in 2021, parent company Restaurant Brands International said on Tuesday. The unsurprising culprit: all those chicken sandwiches from all those fast-food chains.
“There’s a lot of competition, that’s part of the business,” Jose Cil, CEO of Restaurant Brands International, told analysts on Tuesday. “But I think we have a differentiated product with our chicken sandwich as well as our nuggets that were launched and a lot in the innovation pipeline on hand-held chicken.”
Plenty of other figures back up Cil’s comments. For one thing, the company’s sales improved in the fourth quarter from the third, by about 3 percentage points, to a decline of 1.8% in the period ended Dec. 31. Popeyes’ sales late last year were also influenced by other factors—notably reduced store hours and service modes, which hurt sales by 1%, executives said.
Operators are also building more restaurants. Popeyes franchisees added nearly 150 restaurants in the U.S. last year—more than any of RBI’s other three brands added domestically. And despite the recent same-store sales declines, the chain’s average unit volumes remain far higher than they were in 2019, before the company introduced its chicken sandwich.
“It’s important to remember just how significant the step change for Popeyes in the U.S. was,” Cil said. “The business has changed dramatically in terms of AUVs or volumes on a per-store basis as well as four-wall EBITDA for the franchisees.” He was referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Popeyes’ chicken sandwich introduction was the strongest new product introduction in modern history. It helped the chain add $1.6 billion in total system sales since 2018. System sales are now about $4.8 billion.
But the frenzy over the sandwich also generated one of the biggest menu trends in modern history. You’d have an easier time picking the restaurants that didn’t come out with new chicken sandwiches over the past two years.
The biggest of those, however, came from McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, and KFC, Popeyes’ rival.
Both chains generated sales growth last year. KFC had one of its best years in decades in 2021, with system sales up 7% for the full year. McDonald’s U.S. same-store sales rose 13.8%, the best full-year performance in the chain’s history.
Not everyone that introduced chicken sandwiches last year did well with them—Popeyes’ own sister company Burger King struggled most of last year despite its new chicken sandwich. It ultimately overhauled its management and is now planning to spend the year promoting its core products, notably its Whopper.
Popeyes has other efforts that Cil believes will keep customers coming in, notably new innovations—such as the “Hottie Sauce” collaboration late last year with Megan Thee Stallion and new chicken nuggets.
“The key for Popeyes in the U.S. will be to continue to deliver the great-tasting products that we have and do so in a really efficient way in our restaurants,” Cil said.

The Strategies: How Competitors Are Vying for Market Share
To stand out in the crowded fast-food fried chicken market, Popeyes‘ competitors employ a range of strategies, including:
1. Menu Innovation
Many competitors continuously introduce new menu items to keep customers engaged and attract new ones. For example, KFC recently launched its "Kentucky Fried Chicken & Donuts" sandwich, while Chick-fil-A introduced a spicy chicken sandwich and a kale crunch side. These innovations help competitors stay relevant and cater to changing consumer preferences.
2. Value Propositions
Offering competitive prices and value meals is crucial in the fast-food industry. Church‘s Chicken, for instance, focuses on value with its $5 Real Big Deal, which includes a choice of chicken, biscuit, and a side. Bojangles also offers a variety of value combos, such as the "4 for $4" deal, which includes a choice of sandwich, fries, and a drink.
3. Target Demographics
Some competitors focus on specific demographics to build a loyal customer base. Chick-fil-A, for example, targets families and Christian customers with its family-friendly atmosphere and closed-on-Sundays policy. Zaxby‘s, on the other hand, focuses on college students and sports fans through its sponsorships and partnerships.
4. Customer Experience
Providing exceptional customer service and a pleasant dining experience can help competitors differentiate themselves. Chick-fil-A is renowned for its friendly staff and "my pleasure" catchphrase, which contributes to its strong customer loyalty. KFC has also focused on improving its customer experience, with initiatives such as digital ordering kiosks and mobile app rewards.
5. Brand Identity
A strong, recognizable brand identity is essential in the fast-food industry. KFC‘s success is partly due to its iconic founder, Colonel Sanders, and its long-standing secret recipe. Bojangles‘ regional focus and Southern-inspired menu help it maintain a loyal customer base in the Southeastern US. Popeyes has also leveraged its Louisiana heritage and bold flavors to create a distinct brand identity.
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Fast-Food Fried Chicken Market
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the fast-food industry, including the fried chicken market. As dining rooms closed and consumers shifted to takeout and delivery, competitors had to quickly adapt their strategies to meet changing needs.
Chick-fil-A, for example, implemented a "Safe Service" model, which included enhanced cleaning protocols, contactless payment, and drive-thru and curbside pickup options. KFC also focused on drive-thru and delivery, partnering with companies like Grubhub and DoorDash to expand its reach.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, some competitors saw an opportunity to gain market share. Popeyes, in particular, benefited from the viral success of its chicken sandwich, which helped drive sales even during the height of the pandemic. The company reported a 24.8% increase in same-store sales in the third quarter of 2020, outperforming many of its competitors.
The Role of Social Media and Digital Marketing
In today‘s fast-food landscape, social media and digital marketing play a crucial role in shaping brand perception and customer engagement. Competitors that successfully leverage these channels can gain a significant advantage in the market.
Wendy‘s, for example, has gained a reputation for its witty and engaging social media presence, particularly on Twitter. The company‘s snarky tweets and playful jabs at competitors have helped it build a loyal following and generate buzz around its brand.
Chick-fil-A has also leveraged social media to connect with customers and promote its brand values. The company‘s Facebook page features a mix of promotional content, community engagement, and inspirational stories, helping to reinforce its family-friendly image.
Popeyes, meanwhile, has used social media to fuel the hype around its chicken sandwich, with campaigns like the "Chicken Wars" and the "Bring Your Own Bun" promotion. These efforts have helped generate massive amounts of user-generated content and word-of-mouth buzz, driving sales and brand awareness.
The Potential Impact of Emerging Competitors
While established players like KFC, Chick-fil-A, and Popeyes dominate the fast-food fried chicken market, emerging competitors could potentially disrupt the landscape in the coming years.
One such competitor is Dave‘s Hot Chicken, a rapidly growing chain that specializes in Nashville-style hot chicken. Founded in 2017, the company has already expanded to over 40 locations across the US, with plans for further growth. Dave‘s Hot Chicken differentiates itself through its focus on spice levels and its celebrity investor backing, which includes Drake and Samuel L. Jackson.
Another potential disruptor is the rise of ghost kitchens and virtual brands. These delivery-only concepts allow established chains and new entrants to test new menu items and reach customers without the overhead of physical restaurants. KFC, for example, has launched a virtual brand called "KFC Chicken Sandwich," which is available exclusively through delivery apps like Uber Eats and Grubhub.
The Future of the Fast-Food Fried Chicken Market
As the fast-food fried chicken market continues to evolve, several trends and developments could shape the competitive landscape in the coming years:
1. Plant-Based Alternatives
The growing popularity of plant-based meat alternatives, such as those offered by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, may push fried chicken chains to introduce more vegetarian and vegan options. KFC, for example, has tested plant-based chicken in select markets, while Burger King has introduced the Impossible Whopper nationwide.
2. Technology Integration
The increasing use of mobile ordering, delivery services, and AI-powered personalization could change how customers interact with fast-food chains. Competitors that successfully leverage technology may gain an edge in the market. Chick-fil-A, for instance, has invested heavily in its mobile app and loyalty program, which has helped drive sales and customer engagement.
3. International Expansion
As the US market becomes saturated, fast-food fried chicken chains may look to expand internationally to drive growth. Popeyes, for example, has plans to open hundreds of new restaurants in China and other countries in the coming years. KFC, meanwhile, already has a significant global presence, with over 22,000 locations worldwide.
4. Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility
As consumers become more conscious of the environmental and social impact of their food choices, fast-food chains may need to prioritize sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiatives to remain competitive. Chick-fil-A, for example, has committed to using 100% cage-free eggs and has invested in renewable energy projects. Popeyes has also made efforts to reduce its environmental footprint, such as by using sustainable packaging materials.
Conclusion
The fast-food fried chicken market is a dynamic and fiercely competitive space, with established players and new entrants constantly jockeying for position. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. faces significant challenges in maintaining its market share against formidable competitors like KFC, Chick-fil-A, and a host of regional chains.
To stay ahead, Popeyes must continue to innovate its menu, deliver exceptional customer experiences, and adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. By leveraging its unique brand identity, Cajun-inspired flavors, and the success of its fried chicken sandwich, Popeyes has the potential to not only defend its position but also to grow its market share in the years to come.
However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. As the market evolves and new trends emerge, Popeyes will need to be agile, strategic, and customer-focused to thrive in this highly competitive landscape. By staying true to its roots while embracing change, Popeyes can continue to be a major player in the fast-food fried chicken market for years to come.

Weaknesses of Popeyes
Despite its strong market presence, Popeyes also faces certain weaknesses that can impact its performance in the fast-food industry. These weaknesses include its limited global presence, competition with KFC, and a sales decline in 2021.
Limited Global Presence
One of the weaknesses of Popeyes is its limited global presence compared to some of its competitors. While Popeyes has a significant presence in North America, it has a relatively smaller footprint in other regions around the world. This limited global presence limits the brand’s exposure to international markets and potentially hampers its ability to compete on a global scale.
Competition with KFC
Popeyes faces intense competition from various fast-food chains, and one of its primary competitors is KFC. Both Popeyes and KFC operate within the same segment of the industry, offering fried chicken and other menu items. The competition between these two brands can pose challenges for Popeyes in terms of market share and customer loyalty. In order to stay competitive, Popeyes must continuously differentiate itself from KFC and other competitors through its unique offerings, marketing strategies, and customer experience.
Sales Decline in 2021
In 2021, Popeyes experienced a decline in sales, which has been attributed to fierce competition in the chicken sandwich market, particularly with rival chain Chick-fil-A (WATTAgNet). This decline in sales can be seen as a weakness for Popeyes, as it indicates challenges in maintaining its market position and meeting consumer demands. Factors such as intense competition, changing consumer preferences, and supply chain disruptions have contributed to this decline (WATTAgNet).
Despite these weaknesses, Popeyes continues to be a significant player in the fast-food industry. It is important for the company to address these weaknesses and leverage its competitive advantages to overcome challenges and maintain its market share. Additionally, exploring franchise opportunities and implementing effective business strategies can help Popeyes expand its reach and improve its performance in the global market.
Opportunities for Popeyes
As Popeyes continues to grow and expand its market share, several opportunities present themselves for further success and expansion. These opportunities include the growth in the chicken sandwich market, the expansion of the franchise network, and increasing market share.
Growth in the Chicken Sandwich Market
Popeyes has experienced significant growth in the chicken sandwich market, surpassing competitors such as Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s to become a major player in this category. According to QSR Magazine, Popeyes increased its market share in the chicken sandwich category from 10.3% to 25.1% between 2019 and 2021. This success can be attributed to the popularity of its chicken sandwich, which has resonated with consumers and contributed to the growth in market share.
Capitalizing on this opportunity, Popeyes can continue to innovate and expand its chicken sandwich offerings, introducing new flavors and variations to cater to different consumer preferences. By staying ahead of the competition and maintaining its reputation for high-quality and delicious sandwiches, Popeyes can continue to capture a larger share of the chicken sandwich market.
Expansion of Franchise Network
Popeyes has a strong presence in the United States and several international markets, but there is still significant potential for expansion. By offering franchise opportunities, Popeyes can tap into new markets and extend its reach to areas where it currently has limited presence.
Expanding the franchise network allows Popeyes to leverage the local knowledge and expertise of franchisees, helping to adapt the brand to different regional preferences and cultural nuances. This localized approach can help Popeyes establish a stronger foothold in new markets and drive further growth.
Additionally, expanding the franchise network can also help Popeyes capitalize on economies of scale, reduce operational costs, and increase brand visibility through a wider network of locations. By strategically selecting franchise partners and providing strong support and training, Popeyes can ensure consistent brand standards and a seamless customer experience across its franchise locations.

Threats to Popeyes
While Popeyes has experienced significant success and growth in the fast-food industry, it also faces certain threats that can impact its market share and overall performance. These threats include intense competition in the fast-food industry and supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
Intense Competition in the Fast-Food Industry
Popeyes operates in a highly competitive landscape within the fast-food industry. One of its main competitors is KFC, a long-standing and well-established brand in the chicken segment. The competition between Popeyes and KFC is fierce, with Popeyes consistently growing its market presence and challenging KFC’s dominance in the fast-food chicken industry.
Furthermore, the chicken sandwich market has become a battleground for fast-food chains.

Despite the sales decrease, Popeyes still retains a significant market share in the chicken fast-food industry, indicating its strong presence and competitiveness in the market (WATTAgNet).
Supply Chain Disruptions and Labor Shortages
In recent times, Popeyes has faced challenges related to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. These factors can significantly impact the overall performance of the fast-food chain. Supply chain disruptions can lead to delays in the delivery of essential ingredients and products, affecting the availability and quality of menu items.
Additionally, labor shortages can pose challenges in maintaining efficient operations and providing quality service to customers. A shortage of skilled and trained staff can result in longer wait times, decreased customer satisfaction, and potential sales decline. Popeyes’ sales decrease in 2021 has been linked to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, highlighting the impact of these threats on the overall performance of the brand (WATTAgNet).
To mitigate these threats, Popeyes needs to continually adapt its strategies and operations. This may involve implementing efficient supply chain management practices, exploring alternative sourcing options, and investing in employee recruitment and training programs. By addressing these challenges proactively, Popeyes can better position itself to maintain its market share and continue its growth trajectory in the fast-food industry.

Competitive Analysis: Shaping Market Dominance
Popeyes, the renowned fast-food chain, has established its market dominance through a comprehensive competitive analysis strategy. By studying its competitors and the fast food industry landscape, Popeyes has identified unique growth opportunities and positioned itself as a leading player in the market.
With a keen focus on market research and analysis, Popeyes has successfully surpassed KFC to become the second-largest chicken chain in the United States as of October 2023. Operating 3,579 locations nationwide, Popeyes has solidified its presence and expanded its market reach.
The sales figures are a testament to Popeyes’ growth trajectory, with recorded sales of $6.3 billion in the United States in 2023. This significant growth compared to the previous year showcases Popeyes’ ability to capitalize on market trends and consumer preferences.

Popeyes SWOT Analysis: Opportunities Management Has Missed

on Popeyes SWOT Analysis: Opportunities Management Has Missed
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc., also known as Popeyes, is an American chain of fried chicken fast-food restaurants that was founded by Alvin C. Copeland Sr. in New Orleans in 1972. What started with one small restaurant has now swept the United States and the rest of the world with its sensational taste from the company’s 3,400 locations worldwide.
But it wasn’t a smooth sailing ride right from the beginning. Founder Copeland actually started with a donut business but decided to shift to fast-food chicken when KFC first opened its store in New Orleans. Originally, Copeland named his chicken venture “Chicken on the run” but had to close it down when it wasn’t generating enough sales and attracting customers at all. Later on, he re-opened the business along with a new recipe by adding a unique blend of spices to the mixture.
Today, Popeyes has stood its ground as a reputable and well-loved fried chicken fast-food chain, boasting $143 million revenue in the third quarter of 2021, up by 1.2% from the prior-year quarter.
To answer the question, ‘Popeyes VS KFC: Who’s winning?’, let’s take a look at Popeyes SWOT analysis and see where the brand is lacking and has helped the company gain market share over the last 24 months. I also share my ideas on what management can do to improve business performance even further.

Popeyes VS KFC
Strengths
Popeyes is known for fried chicken.
Building the brand to where it is today is no easy feat. But what makes Popeyes one of the famous fried chicken fast-food chains not just in the US but in the rest of the world is the company’s consistency in offering quality products and services to its customers.
Product quality and innovation – Fast-food chains often compromise quality to ensure faster service but not Popeyes that prioritizes quality over everything else. This is evident in their meal prep process as they marinate chicken for 12 hours with a unique blend of seasonings. The same can be said with the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich that resulted in long lines and sold out inventories.
Global expansion – Popeyes knows the path to growth is through expansion. After opening stores in Brazil, Spain, and other countries in Europe and South America, Popeyes opened its flagship store in Shanghai, China, at the height of the global health crisis.
Their China debut marked their most successful grand opening yet as customers waited outside in line to get a hold of their chicken and chicken sandwich. They plan to open over 1,500 restaurants in China over the next decade.
Digital focus on the mobile app and delivery channels – To cater to the younger customers and continue the brand’s innovation, Popeyes launched its first loyalty program called Popeyes Rewards. The program aims to drive more customers by offering exclusive deals and a chance to earn and redeem points using the Popeyes app.
Since the launch of the app, the company’s digital sales accounted for 17% of the total sales in the US in the first quarter of 2021. Starting 2018, Popeyes offers delivery through Uber Eats which reported that orders for fried chicken increased by 54% over the past year.
Weaknesses
Whether you live in the East or West… Everyone loves fried chicken.
While it might feel like Popeyes is firing on all cylinders there are some exposed flanks.
Weak online presence on social media – In this day and age, having a social media presence is very important for any business. With Popeyes, they haven’t gotten the hang of it just yet. With less than a million followers on Facebook as compared to over 57 million KFC followers, we know pretty well Popeyes isn’t doing much in the digital world. The same is true with their Twitter account with just over 250,000 followers while KFC has 1.5 million of its own.
Franchises are mostly at gas stations – Considering Popeyes is not a startup company, you would expect more than having franchises that are mostly at gas stations. Not only does this mean there is less customer traffic but also the fact that there aren’t enough customers who are willing to buy and dine at proper store locations. This can also paint a negative impression of the brand given that it’s been around for years yet we are seeing that franchises don’t seem to be doing as well as they could be.

Store locations are highly concentrated in the South – Given the restaurant chain originated in the South, analysts notice how most of Popeyes store locations are highly concentrated in the South area (Tennessee and Louisiana). The company still has a lot of work ahead of them to win over customers in the Midwest.
Bad customer service – They may have focused too much on product quality and have made a name off it, but Popeyes needs to get their act together when it comes to their customer service. Back in 2016, Popeyes finally admitted their customer service sucks. This admission came after constant complaints on social media from very dissatisfied customers.
Limited menu variety – While Popeyes’ chicken sandwich made a huge impact on customers and became the fast-food phenomenon in 2019 as it continues to do until today there have been a lot of complaints regarding the brand’s lack of other food offerings. Further menu innovation and exploration is advised for this restaurant.
Opportunities
Could deep fried chicken strips be an opportunity for this chain?
Popeyes has the potential to grow further and expand deeper into different markets.
Introduce a healthy menu options – According to the International Food Information Council’s survey, 85% of Americans have changed their diet or the way they prepare their meals during the pandemic. For a fast-food chain like Popeyes, one way they can attract more customers is by introducing a handful of healthy menu items.
Use Popeye the sailor man to enhance the brand image – Popeye the sailor man is a fictional character that made its debut in the daily King Features comic strip called Thimble Theatre on January 17, 1929, which later on also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons. Given Popeye’s popularity and having the same name as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, it would give the fast-food chain a boost in their brand image if they used Popeye the sailor man as part of their branding and marketing efforts.
Entry into the emerging Asian markets – As an American brand, it’s not always easy to expand internationally where taste preferences and eating habits can be very different. But this doesn’t mean one shouldn’t even try to make a move. After Popeyes’ successful launch in China, the company should try to further deepen its footprint and continue opening its stores in more Asian markets such as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. 
Threats
It’s smart for businesses to understand the threat to their business model. This helps management prepare for changes in market dynamics.
Rising cost of ingredients – If there was one consistent threat that always hit restaurants, it is the rising cost of ingredients. Restaurant owners have accepted the fact that there will always be a rise in the cost of ingredients but with the pandemic hitting hard and caused a variety of supply chain issues, even big fast-food chains like Popeyes are facing a difficult time dealing with it. The only way out is if Popeyes can either cut costs or pass those expenses onto the customer through menu price increases.

Highly competitive industry – With over 200,000 fast-food restaurants in the US, saying that the competition in this industry is tough is an understatement. Plus the fact that Popeyes’ direct competition includes KFC, McDonald’s and Burger King – some of the country’s leading global fast-food chains. Consistency in product quality and service should remain as Popeyes’ main priority if they want to continue swimming forward and not just treading water.
Rising health conscious individuals – Obesity has long been considered a major health issue in America where 42.5% of adults aged 20 and over are suffering from obesity. This opened the eyes of many individuals who are starting to rethink the fuel they put into their bodies. As a popular fast-food chain, it would be difficult for Popeyes to keep attracting customers if a big percentage of their target audience are starting to eat healthy or are health conscious.
Popeyes VS KFC: Who is winning?
What chicken restaurant do you prefer?
Now that we’ve taken a look at Popeyes’s SWOT analysis, let’s go back to the question of who is winning between Popeyes and KFC? With both fast-food chains being two of the country’s well-loved in the industry and each having their own share of dedicated fans through the years, it might be difficult to know who exactly is winning without looking at the cold hard numbers.
In terms of the number of store locations, it’s a landslide win with KFC’s 3,984 locations in the US only, plus 5,200 stores in China versus Popeyes’ 3,400 locations worldwide. Given that KFC has more locations in the country and worldwide, one can assume that KFC would generate more revenue than Popeyes. So how much is it exactly?
It is reported that in 2020, KFC was valued at $5.4 billion while Popeyes’ revenue in the 3rd quarter of 2021 is $143 million, up 1.2% from the previous year.
Now, let’s talk about the most important thing – the food. Both Popeyes and KFC serve similar products like fried chicken, chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, biscuits and more. But who has better food? Is KFC winning with their years of experience and proven secret blend of herbs? Or is Popeyes on the lead with their extra crunchy, mild and spicy chicken offerings?

Fans say that Popeyes is winning when it comes to crunch and it leveled up even more thanks to KFC chicken’s dryness. Some people also shared that when it comes to slides, Popeyes is on the lead. But I think that when it comes to taste, it is pretty much personal preference as one would debate KFC has better food if they don’t really like the Cajun approach from Popeyes or vice versa, someone saying that Popeyes has leveled up the fried chicken approach with their extra crisp and flavor.
I think we can all agree that the debate between the best fried chicken chain will continue to rage on for the foreseeable future. One thing is for sure, Popeyes still has plenty of growth potential.
Having seven times less store locations as KFC but gaining over $100 million in revenue last year, Popeyes clearly knows what they’re doing and if they focus on improving their customer service which has been highly criticized for years. The chicken chain seems poised to make a fortune in the years, especially if they can replicate the release of their now famous chicken sandwich that took American’s taste buds by storm in 2019.

Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A: how they really measure up
Popeyes may be trolling Chick-fil-A on Twitter, but the latter has the former where it counts: in the numbers

What's better than a fried-chicken Twitter battle on a Monday?
Stick with us.
After Popeyes ($QSR) added a new chicken sandwich to its menu, Chick-fil-A ($PRIVATE:PRIV_CHICKFILA) tweeted earlier today that its iteration of the fried chicken sandwich was "the original". It did so without mentioning Popeyes by name which, in the Twitterverse, is called a "subtweet", which, in the Twitterverse, is a questionable move. Understandably, Chick-fil-A has a bit of a swagger right now, as it's considered by many to be the fastest growing fast food chain.
But Popeyes wasn't having any of that, so it responded with "... y'all good?" in a clear taunt and recognition of the sub-tweet.
The response lit up Twitter with over 70,000 likes and 26,000 retweets so far. Sadly, for Chick-fil-A at least, its original tweet has only seen 2,000 likes and 373 retweets, in what is being seen as a social-media rally in favor of Popeyes.
First, a little level setting here. Chick-fil-A far outpaces Popeyes when it comes to Twitter followers, by a factor of 9.6 to 1. Which makes what happened even more surprising.
But other data points to clear wins for Popeyes. Popeyes isn't just beating Chick-fil-A in retweets today. Its global store count outpaces that of Chick-fil-A.
Popeyes has a solid presence not just in the United States, but also in South America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (it's also huge in South Korea).
The number of Popeyes locations throughout the world tops 4,000, with 3,000 of those in the United States alone. Its revenue in 2016 was $269 million. In 2018, it was bought out by Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (it also owns Tim Hortons), which reported 2018 revenues totaling $5.4 billion.
Popeyes restaurant foot traffic, as measured by Facebook ($FB) "Were Here" count, is healthy. It's grown to 1.12 million and looks on pace to continue to grow in popularity. But before you give Popeyes the social media edge, see below.
Chick-fil-A isn't too far behind with more than 2,300 locations throughout The United States and Canada. Meanwhile, its revenue in 2018 was $10.5 billion - almost twice that of Popeyes plus its siblings under RBI.
Chick-fil-A's "Were Here" count is closing in on a massive 8 million — that's 8 million selfies, check-ins, and Facebook status updates from Chick-fil-A's 2,300 locations. That far outpaces Popeye's count.
So who wins? Only one way to find out: see you at lunch tomorrow.

The many, many conversations about fried chicken sandwiches, explained
On Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A vs. our collective sanity.
by Rachel Sugar
Aug 28, 2019, 1:40 PM EDT
Jacqueline Day for Vox
It is official: Popeyes is out of the Sandwich. The chicken wells have run dry.
“Popeyes aggressively forecasted demand through the end of September and has already sold through that inventory,” a release from the company explains. “As a result, Popeyes restaurants across the country are expected to sell out of the Chicken Sandwich by the end of this week. We, along with our suppliers, are working tirelessly to bring the new sandwich back to guests as soon as possible.”
It is the logical endpoint of the recent fried chicken frenzy. If you have, for some reason, missed it, distracted by things that are not chicken sandwiches, here is what happened. On August 12, Popeyes, a beloved Louisiana fried chicken chain now headquartered in Miami, debuted its new fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich features a slab of crunchy fried chicken breast on brioche with pickles and mayonnaise. It comes in two varieties: The mayonnaise can be either spicy or not. Does this sound reminiscent of another chicken sandwich you know? Correct.
A week passed, and mostly, the world went on. And then on Monday, Chick-fil-A — America’s favorite restaurant, according to the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, for the fourth year in a row, despite its controversial political history — wrote a tweet. The tweet said: “Bun+Chicken+Pickles = all the [heart] for the original.” It did not mention Popeyes. It was just listing the ingredients of the chain’s core chicken sandwich. It was just saying — apropos of nothing! — that it had come first.
Chicken sandwich enthusiasts on Twitter were quick to take notice, and within a few hours, Popeyes — or rather, the advertising agency GSD&M, which oversees the chain’s social media strategy — fired back with its pièce de résistance: a quote tweet, plus a low-key expression of concern: “… y’all good?” it asked.
With that, the war was on, and everyone from passionate lay chicken enthusiasts to chicken professionals was weighing in. The conversation on Twitter, fueled by Black Twitter in particular, clustered around the hashtags #ChickenWars, and #ChickenSandwichWars, and the less combative, more descriptive #ChickenSandwichTwitter. Apex Marketing Group, an advertising consultancy in Michigan, released a report estimating that Popeyes received $23.25 million in free advertising, according to Reuters.
On Twitter and in the burgeoning chicken sandwich literature, the arguments generally break down like this. First, there are the flavor arguments, which examine the sandwiches on their comparative sandwich-related merits. Popeyes tastes better; Chick-fil-A tastes better; or the slightly more nuanced variation: Popeyes is better because I can now eat a delicious fast food chicken sandwich without supporting the politics of Chick-fil-A.
Still others pointed out that, despite the promise of Popeyes, there is no such thing as a morally pure fried chicken fast food sandwich. Fast food is built on factory farms and inhumane labor practices — poultry processing, heavily reliant on immigrant workers, is among the “lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs in the country,” and working conditions at the fast food restaurants themselves are notoriously grim. Which, of course, we all kind of know: A sandwich that costs $3.99 is almost certainly the product of some exploitation.
The latest dispatches from the front lines seem only to confirm the point, and highlight it in neon. Reports say some Popeyes employees have been working “more than 60-hour weeks” to keep up with overwhelming demand. “Everyone wanted to quit so bad because it was that bad,” one crew member in Orange County told Business Insider. “I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out,” a manager on the East Coast said.
(A fifth group, for a time, was other brands, including Wendy’s, which sells noted chicken sandwiches, and Yelp, which sells no sandwiches at all, attempting to break into the chicken discourse with their own hyped-up promotion.)
(Then a sixth discourse emerged, with some high-profile people — Judge Joe Brown and Janelle Monáe among them — suggesting African Americans cared more about standing in line for chicken sandwiches than voting or self-empowerment. This idea, which seemed to play into racist tropes, was not well received. Others were quick to point out that African Americans do wait in line to vote; that the problem is voter suppression; and that it really shouldn’t be easier to buy a hyped-up sandwich than to vote, and yet it often is. Monáe apologized.)
This is all to say that there is almost no discussion about life in America that cannot be had through chicken sandwiches. “People want chicken to do this heavy lifting that they’re not themselves willing to do,” says Psyche Williams-Forson, chair of American studies at the University of Maryland and the author of Building Houses Out of Chicken Legs, a study of the roles, both literal and symbolic, that chicken has played in some African American women’s lives. The story of the #ChickenWars is a story about brand identity. It is a story of human identity. It is a story about chicken.
Fast food chicken sandwiches are a point of personal pride, with a complicated history
It is hard to imagine two brands better positioned for a high-profile battle. Chick-fil-A is a fast food chicken pioneer. But it did not, contrary to its claims, invent the very concept of the fried chicken sandwich in the early 1960s — a history that erases the culinary legacy of African Americans. At Ebony, food journalist Donna Battle Pierce, searching black newspaper archives, traces the fried chicken sandwich back to at least 1936.
“[Chick-fil-A] invented, maybe, a modern take on the chicken sandwich,” says Williams-Forson. “They invented this new way of marketing a chicken sandwich. But when folks laid down at night back in the day and they wanted a late-night snack, and there [was] a loaf of bread, and some meat that was left over from dinner or supper, they put those pieces of food together, and while they may not have said, ‘this is the chicken sandwich!’ in fact that’s what it was.”
Like the history of fried chicken itself (and like most food histories), the origins of the fried chicken sandwich are hard to definitively trace. “When we start talking about origins, I think we run into a lot of different problems,” Williams-Forson says, because “foods travel, animals travel, spices travel.” Fried chicken has Scottish and African origins, and the version we know today builds on both.
There is almost no discussion about life in America that cannot be had through chicken sandwiches
So Chick-fil-A did not “invent” the chicken sandwich. At the same time, though, the brand’s impact on the chicken sandwich is undeniable. As most of the industry struggles, Chick-fil-A keeps growing, and this June, officially assumed its place as the third-largest restaurant chain in the US, up from the seventh.
In the world of fried chicken franchises, according to a July industry report from IBISWorld, the chain has 27.9 percent of chicken market share, more than any other single band. This is despite the chain’s continued history of making donations to anti-LGBTQ causes, ThinkProgress notes, and the company’s refusal to include sexual orientation and gender identification in its employment nondiscrimination policy. Chick-fil-A may be the incumbent chicken champ, but there is room for an insurgent.
In this case, the insurgent is Popeyes. Per IBISWorld, Popeyes has less than half of Chick-fil-A’s market share, with 10.1 percent, but its chicken is beloved, not just by regular fast food diners but also by critics and highbrow chefs. “Popeyes fried chicken is fantastic,” wrote chicken poet and New Yorker food correspondent Helen Rosner. “The meat is flavorful and juicy, encased in a spiky, golden sea urchin of batter — surprisingly light, uncommonly crispy.” Chef Wylie Dufresne, who is known for popularizing molecular gastronomy — molecular gastronomy! — served Popeyes at his wedding, because, as he told First We Feast, it’s “just the most delicious chicken.”
Popeyes and Chick-fil-A both sell chicken to lots of groups of people. But as Williams-Forson observes, there is — at least in perception — a kind of racial affiliation, As the narrative goes, she says, “Popeyes equals black, and Chick-fil-A equals non-black, which is kind of interesting to me,” and she isn’t alone.
“I have no scientific basis for saying this, but I think Popeyes has more brand loyalty with African Americans because there seem to be more outlets in black neighborhoods, the spicy IS spicy, and the food is cheaper,” soul food scholar Adrian Miller told me. “I don’t really see Chick-fil-A in black neighborhoods.” A 2013 Washington Post article chalks this up to strategy: “Traditionally, Popeyes has been focused on the ‘urban’ market, which in retail parlance can be code for ‘black.’”
Popeyes underwent a corporate makeover in the late 2000s, which included tweaking the name “Popeyes Chicken ’n Biscuits” to the more locavorian “Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,” along with a push to expand into “the suburbs.” And yet, despite the revamp, part of the delight of Popeyes is in how it hasn’t changed: “What I like most about Popeyes,” writes poet and critic Hanif Abdurraqib at Medium, “is that the space demands you to come exactly as you are. There’s a type of equality leveled at a patron ... within the walls of Popeyes, no one is too good or too educated to not be treated like a burden for someone behind the counter.”
By contrast, Abdurraqib writes that he finds Chick-fil-A, despite its politics, or perhaps because of them, “a bit too sanitized for my liking.” Chick-fil-A, maybe, does not want you to come exactly as you are, but the bathrooms are the cleanest in the industry.
Until recently, Popeyes, like almost every other player in the industry, had failed to produce a god-level chicken sandwich. Last year, McDonald’s introduced a fancy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich, and the world mostly stayed calm. McDonald’s is not a fried chicken leader. Popeyes, on the other hand, was uniquely positioned to ruffle feathers for one simple reason: It is threateningly good.
That the fight exists at all is a testament to the rising tides of the fast food chicken sandwich
As a general category, chicken has been on the rise since the early 1980s. In 1977, the McGovern Senate report laid out a first set of dietary guidelines, which “created serious shock waves about the perils of red meat,” says Adam Chandler, author of Drive-Thru Dreams, about the American history of fast food. Chicken could be the answer. Heavily processed fast food chicken wasn’t actually healthy, but it exuded a health-adjacent glow, because it is not beef.
A 1984 New York Times article chronicled the boom, noting that chicken had become “the fastest-growing segment of the fast-food industry.” People were eating more chicken than ever, because it was “cheaper and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, and market studies indicate that women prefer chicken,” which is a statement we must unpack another time.
But while McNuggets flourished as soon as they were introduced, in 1981, the fast food fried chicken sandwich has been tougher to perfect. It is always further in the distance, just inches out of reach. McDonald’s introduced the first McChicken sandwich in 1980, then abandoned it, and then brought it back, and has flip-flopped ever since.
In an age of drive-thrus, a sandwich is practical in a way a bucket isn’t: You can eat it while you drive. In 2005, McDonald’s debuted an attempted Chick-fil-A competitor, the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich, but pulled it in 2015. Burger King had a megahit in 1990 with the broiled-not-fried BK Broiler, but it lost momentum two years later and has been cycling through new iterations ever since. Wendy’s has a fried chicken sandwich, and so does Arby’s, and so, too, does White Castle, which was news to me.
Yet the goal remains. Shoot for the moon, the saying goes; even if you miss, you’ll end up with a fried chicken sandwich.
The chicken fight is not over yet
“The fastest-growing food over the last 10 years in the restaurant industry has been fried chicken sandwiches,” one analyst told the New York Times in 2008. A decade later, the quest still marches on. In 2016, Bon Appétit announced that we had reached “peak fried chicken sandwich mania,” citing Shake Shack’s much-buzzed-over entry into the category, the Chick’n Shack, as evidence.
The data backed it up: Between 2011 and 2016, chicken sales at quick-service and fast-casual restaurants catapulted 42.1 percent, according to the market research firm Euromonitor International. Chicken chains were thriving, and non-chicken chains were doubling down on extra chicken offerings: It was, let us never forget, the era of Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa, which used a blanket of fried chicken where the tortilla was supposed to go.
The reasons for the increasing chicken mania are more or less the same as they ever were. Chicken is still cheaper than beef. It still seems healthy in a way that beef does not — not just for you personally, but for the environment, because, again, it is not beef. It is novel, compared to the crushing hegemony of burgers. And it is trendy.
Shoot for the moon, the saying goes; even if you miss, you’ll end up with a fried chicken sandwich
The past two decades, Miller says, have seen an increasing interest in regional American cooking, and one of “the most dynamic and popular regions is the American South,” and so of course there’s massive interest in fried chicken. For high-end chefs, the chicken sandwich has become a kind of test, a blank canvas on which to display their culinary chops. In 2015, both David Chang (at Fuku) and Danny Meyer (at Shake Shack) debut their high-end fast-casual fried chicken sandwich iterations.
This is great because fried chicken is delicious, but, as Osayi Endolyn writes in an essay on fried chicken for the book You and I Eat the Same, that catapulting trendiness is “where things can get tricky.” Enslaved people were known for selling chicken as far back as Mount Vernon — this is the beginning of the long and fraught relationship between African Americans and chicken — and after emancipation, newly free black women, known as “waiter carriers,” began cooking and selling fried chicken to travelers at pretty much every train stop in the South, one of many, many historically uncredited but increasingly appreciated contributions African and African American cooks have made to what we now consider Southern food.
But when you look at who gets famous — and rich — things get dicey. “There is a distinct pattern in the United States, wherein African American chefs struggle to find parity with their white counterparts in terms of recognition, funding, and reward,” Endolyn writes. “Both codified and unspoken social policies ensured that the black women who worked as waiter carriers in the nineteenth century never saw their business become a global franchise.”
Even now, when it comes to chicken, the big players (Chick-fil-A and Popeyes among them) have white founders and white CEOs. When the #ChickenWars broke out — again, driven largely by the enthusiasm of Black Twitter — it wasn’t lost on the participants who was doing the work, and who was getting paid.
So who, ultimately, wins the #ChickenSandwichWar?
If Chick-fil-A is the reigning king of the chicken sandwich, the pressure is on to usurp the throne. McDonald’s US franchisees have been urging the company to develop a chicken sandwich to rival Chick-fil-A’s, what the defunct Southern Style could have been but wasn’t. “Chick-fil-A’s results demonstrate the power of chicken,” the National Owners Association board wrote in an email to fellow operators last month, just. “Chick-fil-A invented the Chicken Sandwich, but we can do one better.” Can they, though? It is unclear. Can Popeyes? By most accounts, they can.
And yet the counterintuitive beauty of a fast food Twitter dispute is that there are no losers. Fast food chains have harnessed the power of Twitter the way almost no other industry has. Though it contains multitudes, fast food brand Twitter tends to be absurd, or whimsical, or vaguely embarrassing; it is pop-culture obsessed and sometimes ill-advised. It is in on the somewhat uncomfortable joke, which is that brands are not people, even if they pretend to act like them. At the same time, though, fast food brands are so ingrained in American culture that we do, sort of, have emotional, humanoid relationships with them.
Chick-fil-A made an overture, and Popeyes responded — “we saw a major boost in organic conversations about the excellent quality of our sandwich and we felt it made sense to jump in and participate,” a spokesperson told me — and the result was that for a few brief hours, everyone was talking about chicken all the time. “Because taste and fandom are subjective,” says Chandler, “everyone wins in a fast food social media war.”

Chicken sandwich competition takes a bite out of Popeyes
But the chain’s sales improved last quarter and it remains in a much stronger position than it was three years ago.

It turns out that, when a bunch of your competitors introduce a product just like yours, it can have an influence on sales.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen received a lesson in this last year. The chicken chain introduced its new chicken sandwich permanently in November 2019, generated the strongest quarterly same-store sales in modern industry history and then largely kept sales strong even through the pandemic.
But those sales slowed last year. U.S. same-store sales declined 2% in 2021, parent company Restaurant Brands International said on Tuesday. The unsurprising culprit: all those chicken sandwiches from all those fast-food chains.
“There’s a lot of competition, that’s part of the business,” Jose Cil, CEO of Restaurant Brands International, told analysts on Tuesday. “But I think we have a differentiated product with our chicken sandwich as well as our nuggets that were launched and a lot in the innovation pipeline on hand-held chicken.”
Plenty of other figures back up Cil’s comments. For one thing, the company’s sales improved in the fourth quarter from the third, by about 3 percentage points, to a decline of 1.8% in the period ended Dec. 31. Popeyes’ sales late last year were also influenced by other factors—notably reduced store hours and service modes, which hurt sales by 1%, executives said.
Operators are also building more restaurants. Popeyes franchisees added nearly 150 restaurants in the U.S. last year—more than any of RBI’s other three brands added domestically. And despite the recent same-store sales declines, the chain’s average unit volumes remain far higher than they were in 2019, before the company introduced its chicken sandwich.
“It’s important to remember just how significant the step change for Popeyes in the U.S. was,” Cil said. “The business has changed dramatically in terms of AUVs or volumes on a per-store basis as well as four-wall EBITDA for the franchisees.” He was referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Popeyes’ chicken sandwich introduction was the strongest new product introduction in modern history. It helped the chain add $1.6 billion in total system sales since 2018. System sales are now about $4.8 billion.
But the frenzy over the sandwich also generated one of the biggest menu trends in modern history. You’d have an easier time picking the restaurants that didn’t come out with new chicken sandwiches over the past two years.
The biggest of those, however, came from McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, and KFC, Popeyes’ rival.
Both chains generated sales growth last year. KFC had one of its best years in decades in 2021, with system sales up 7% for the full year. McDonald’s U.S. same-store sales rose 13.8%, the best full-year performance in the chain’s history.
Not everyone that introduced chicken sandwiches last year did well with them—Popeyes’ own sister company Burger King struggled most of last year despite its new chicken sandwich. It ultimately overhauled its management and is now planning to spend the year promoting its core products, notably its Whopper.
Popeyes has other efforts that Cil believes will keep customers coming in, notably new innovations—such as the “Hottie Sauce” collaboration late last year with Megan Thee Stallion and new chicken nuggets.
“The key for Popeyes in the U.S. will be to continue to deliver the great-tasting products that we have and do so in a really efficient way in our restaurants,” Cil said.
