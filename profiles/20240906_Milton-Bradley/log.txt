Susan: Gathering detailed and verifiable information on any entity, such as Milton-Bradley, will require careful planning, exploration of reliable sources and critiques of collected data. Here's the general approach we can use:

1. **Company Overview:** Begin by checking Milton-Bradley's official website for general information about the company like its mission, vision, values, history, leadership, financial performance, brands, products, and corporate social responsibility initiatives. Such information will provide a general understanding of the company.

2. **Key Decision Makers:** We'll need to identify the top executives in the organization. This usually can be found in the 'About Us' or 'Leadership' section of the company's website. Once identified, online platforms such as LinkedIn, Forbes, Bloomberg, and other financial or news outlets can be scanned to collect further information and identify possible points of leverage.

3. **Financial Information:** We will seek information from reputable finance websites, investor relations sections on the company's website, annual reports, and SEC filings. Websites that analyze stock performance such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and CNBC may also give confirmatory information about the company's financial health.

4. **Labor Relations:** Trade journals and specialized labor publications, labor union websites, labor departments, or labor boards may carry news on labor relations involving Milton-Bradley. News sites may also report on significant labor disputes or negotiations.

5. **Recent Scandals:** This would involve a thorough search of news websites, industry publications, and other potential sources of relevant news. Checking watchdog websites and even social media could provide information about any controversies involving the company.

6. **Other Points of Leverage:** These could include any significant negative publicity, environmental record, outstanding legal issues, and competitor analysis. Information about these can also be found from reliable news websites, legal information websites, and business information databases.

Finally, all data collected would need to be cross-checked for accuracy across multiple sources. Regular monitoring and updating would also be crucial to ensure that the most current information on Milton-Bradley is available to help inform your strategy.
