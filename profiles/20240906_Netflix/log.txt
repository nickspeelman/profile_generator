Susan: To gather information on 'Netflix', we should follow a comprehensive fivefold strategy. 

1. **Company Overview:** Start with basic information like headquarters location, size of organization (number of employees), primary industry, operation territories, and a brief history. This would provide a holistic overview of the company.

2. **Financial Information:** Make use of available tools such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or Reuters. Look at their revenues, profits, operating costs, and recent financial news. Determine company's market share, ratings, and the latest news on their stock performance. Review recent quarterly or annual reports from the investor relations section on Netflix's website.

3. **Key Decision Makers:** Identify executives, the Board of Directors, critical shareholders and their bio-data. Determine the percentages of the company they own, and any pressure points, i.e., other businesses they own, their public reputation and philanthropic interests.

4. **Company's Labor Relations:** Complete a deep dive on the past and recent labor-relations history. This involves workforce morale, trade unions' involvement, strikes or walkouts, wage issues or layoffs. Use resources like news portals, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and other employee review sites. Research any lawsuits against the company.

5. **Scandals, Legal Issues & Reputational Risks:** Search for historical and recent scandals or legal issues involving Netflix. Investigate through sources like news outlets, legal databases, and business news websites. Consider the wider impacts of potential risks, such as boycotts or protests against the company.

6. **Reviews and Social Listening:** Monitor reviews posted by employees on platforms like Glassdoor, Indeed, and PayScale. Social listening on forums, and platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and other social media can also provide real-time updates about what is being said about the company. 

All the information gathered will need to be cross-verified using multiple open web resources to ensure its credibility.
