Susan: The research on Cabell Huntington Hospital could be organized in the following way:

1. **Financial Information**: Start with corporate and regulatory filings, stockholder reports, and analyses found on financial websites like Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, or the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database. These will offer insights into the hospital's financial health, key revenue sources, notable expenses, and other economic factors. 

2. **Key Decision Makers**: Find the identities of decision-makers such as CEO, CFO, Board Members, top executives, and other powerful stakeholders. This information can be found directly on the hospital’s website or online professional networks like LinkedIn. Once identified, research each person individually, focusing on their professional and possibly personal backgrounds to identify potential points of leverage.

3. **Labor Relations**: Look for information from both mainstream news sources and industry-specific publications that would have articles or reports on the hospital's dealings with labor unions or worker disputes. This might include reports on strikes, negotiations, or conflicts as well as positive initiatives to improve employee well-being.

4. **Recent Scandals**: Dig through recent news reports, investigative journalism pieces, and press releases related to the hospital on national as well as local news websites. Use search engines to look for any controversies, lawsuits, or negative press involving the institution. 

5. **Possible Points of Leverage on the Employer**: Use the information you’ve compiled to identify possible areas of leverage. These might include a need for positive PR (if recent bad press), financial vulnerability, key policies or stances of identified decision makers, and diversity or attrition issues among their workforce.

6. **Local Dynamics**: Try to understand the socioeconomic dynamics of the region where the hospital operates. Local news media, public health departments, and community blogs could give you a clearer picture of any local issues the hospital might face.

It's important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of your research largely depends on the quality and reliability of your sources. Stick to reputable sources, cross verify information wherever possible, and maintain an updated, organized repository of your findings.
Manny: I appreciate the detailed approach, Susan. Here are some follow-up questions I have:

1. Could you provide more insight into the most effective methods for researching the financial health of a not-for-profit entity like a hospital? How might this be different from researching a publicly traded company?

2. When investigating key decision makers, how deep should we delve into their personal backgrounds? Are there any ethical lines that we shouldn't cross while gathering this information?

3. If our searches for any recent scandals involving the hospital come up dry, should we extend the search time frame or focus more on other aspects of the project?

4. Can you suggest any specific resources or databases to explore for information about labor relations, especially in the healthcare industry?

5. In terms of possible points of leverage, can you clarify how we differentiate between a 'point of leverage' and an 'attack point'? Is our goal to find vulnerabilities or to identify areas for constructive negotiation?

6. Regarding the local dynamics, how can we ensure that we take a balanced view and not overly focus on negative aspects when examining socioeconomic issues and local challenges?
Susan: 1. **Researching Financial Statistics:** Start by conducting a financial analysis of the Cabell Huntington Hospital. This can be accomplished by searching for any publicly available financial reports or statements through their website or associated organizations. You can also search for news articles or reports that might provide insight into their financial situation. Look for any trends, such as increasing or decreasing profits, operational costs, and capital investments. 

2. **Identifying Key Decision Makers:** The next step is to identify the key decision makers in the organization. This list would typically include individuals like the CEO, CFO, board members, and other high-ranking executives within the organization. Gather as much information as possible about these individuals, such as their backgrounds, previous work experience, and any potential points of leverage. Social media platforms and company websites are good places to start. 

3. **Researching Labor Relations:** Investigate the hospital's labor relations history, looking specifically for any labor disputes, lawsuits, or other issues involving employees. Scrutinize the hospital's treatment of its workforce—the nursing staff, supporting staff, interns, and other employees. Look for reports or articles on strikes, wage disputes, or unfair working conditions. 

4. **Scouring for Scandals:** Look for any recent scandals or negative news involving the hospital. This might be a bad reputation for patient care, mismanagement of funds, or controversy over executive compensation. Investigating local news articles, comments, and forums could uncover information not covered in larger media outlets. 

5. **Studying Regulatory Environment:** Assess Cabell Huntington's compliance with healthcare regulations. Try to find if there were instances of non-compliance, fines, or regulatory actions taken against the hospital. Key sources include reports from regulatory agencies, court records, or news articles.

6. **Consolidation of Information:** Once all this information is gathered, compile it into a comprehensive, easy-to-understand report for the union. Identify potential points of leverage, such as financial instability, labor relations problems, scandals or legal issues.

7. **Update and Monitoring:** Establish a method to keep track of any new developments related to hospital finance, labor relations, key decision makers, etc. Setting up news alerts on specific topics or key words related to Cabell Huntington Hospital might be helpful.

Remember, sources should be credible, factual, and accurate to ensure the legitimacy of your findings. Use a variety of sources for information, from official websites to news articles, so as to gather a balanced perspective.
Manny: Thanks for directing Susan's strategy. Here are a couple of follow-up questions for her:

1. **Credible Sources:** Since we are relying on open web research, how can we verify the credibility of the sources we find? What should we look out for to ensure we are collecting accurate information?

2. **Financial Information:** Due to the nature of financial information being sometimes difficult to find or understand, do we have a specific strategy on how to analyze and interpret it, especially when the information is intricate or not openly available?

3. **Points of Leverage:** Can she provide some specific examples of what potential 'points of leverage' might look like in the context of a hospital like Cabell Huntington?

4. **Regulatory Environment:** What are the key healthcare regulations that we should look into when studying the regulatory environment for Cabell Huntington Hospital?

5. **Monitoring updates:** What tools or resources would she recommend to set up efficient news alerts or tracking systems? 

6. **Turning Information into Action:** Once we have compiled the report and identified the points of leverage, how could we suggest this information be used to influence negotiations or actions by the union?

7. **Privacy Concerns:** How should we be mindful of privacy laws and ethical considerations while collecting information about key decision makers in the organization?
Susan: Thanks for the questions, Manny. Here are my answers:

1. **Credible Sources:** Verify the credibility of the sources by cross-referencing information from multiple sources, checking the publishing date to ensure the information is current, and evaluating the reputation of the publishing organization. Stick to reputable news outlets, official websites, and trusted industry publications.

2. **Financial Information:** Not all financial information will be openly available, especially for private entities. However, you might find indirect indicators like major investments in facilities, acquisitions, layoffs, or unpaid debts. News articles and press releases can also provide insight into financial health. Regulatory filings with government agencies, if available, can be a rich source of information as well.

3. **Points of Leverage:** In the context of a hospital like Cabell Huntington, 'points of leverage' could include employee dissatisfaction over pay or working conditions, public controversy over patient care, negative financial trends, regulatory issues, or strong competition in the region. 

4. **Regulatory Environment:** Look at healthcare-specific regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, as well as compliance with Medicare/Medicaid or state-specific health regulations.

5. **Monitoring updates:** Google Alerts can be a useful tool to monitor online news and updates. Feedly can track blogs and news sites, while TweetDeck can monitor social media.

6. **Turning Information into Action:** The union could use this information to guide their negotiation strategy, knowing where the employer is most vulnerable. Issues of employee welfare or public image might be used to press for better working conditions or pay. Financial or regulatory weaknesses can be used to argue against claims that the employer cannot afford to meet worker demands.

7. **Privacy Concerns:** Always respect privacy laws and ethical boundaries when performing research. Only use publicly available information; never attempt to access confidential personal information about individuals in the organization. Stick to professional information and behavior relevant to the job role, not personal or potentially discriminatory information.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Full text of "Full Filing" for fiscal year ending Sept. 2019
Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - Mountain Health Network has a new leader.
Thursday, Mountain Health Network and Cabell Huntington Hospital Board of Directors announced the departure of Chief Executive Officer Mike Mullins.
Officials say Mullins is leaving to “pursue other opportunities.”
Mike Mullins was named the president and CEO back in 2019.
New president and CEO named at Mountain Health Network
“Mr. Mullins has served our system well as CEO for the last two years,” stated Beth Hammers, Chair, Board of Directors for Cabell Huntington Hospital and Mountain Health Network. “He has led the system’s integration, delivered on planned synergies, and provided structure and stability through the historic pandemic. Additionally, Mullins has been focused on strategic opportunities, such as the purchase of HIMG in 2020. The Board thanks Mr. Mullins for his contributions and wishes him well in his future endeavors.”
The Board of Directors has named Paul English Smith to lead as Interim CEO for Mountain Health Network and President of Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center.
Smith has been General Counsel of Mountain Health Network since 2019.
Prior to his system position, he served Cabell Huntington Hospital as Vice President and General Counsel for over thirty years.
Mountain Health says Smith has extensive experience in healthcare law, insurance and hospital operations. Smith will assume Mullins’ duties while the Board proceeds with conducting the selection process for the next CEO.
Smith released the following statement Thursday evening:
“I am honored to serve as Interim CEO and support the great work that Mountain Health Network is doing for our community. As a member of the Cabell Huntington Hospital and now the Mountain Health Network leadership team for the past 35 years, I have had the privilege of having a front row seat for the changes in Huntington health care that have grown our community into a regional health care destination. Today, we have two excellent hospitals, an experienced leadership team, a committed board and outstanding medical staff and employees who are dedicated to continuing our mission to improve the well-being of all we serve.”
Further details on this transition will be provided as the information becomes available.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — Cabell Huntington Hospital workers filled Huntington City Council's chambers Monday night, but council members decided not to back a resolutionin the labor dispute.
Service and maintenance workers at the hospital have now been on strike for 20 days. Councilman Bob Bailey said council needed to support all union workers and wrote a resolution for both Cabell Huntington Hospital and Special Metals to come back to the bargaining table. Special Metals workers have also been on strike for almost three months.
Bailey's resolution was killed.
Councilman Pat Jones called for the two institutions to come up with a solution to get their employees back to work. He said if that didn't happen in the next two weeks, he will introduce a resolution.
Council members also voted to create a new deputy chief position inside the Huntington Police Department. The person in the new position will help with community policing and recruitment.
Right now, the vote only approves the position and it's up to Mayor Steve Williams to appoint an officer. Williams is expected to appoint Lt. Phil Watkins.
Council members also gave the Cabell Huntington Health Department approval to continue its needle exchange program. Enforcement by the local government is just one part of West Virginia's new law that requires harm reduction programs to get a license. Williams called the health department's program essential and a "no brainer" to support.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

Two retired hospital workers filed a federal lawsuit accusing West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital of terminating retiree health coverage after repeatedly telling non-union workers they would receive lifetime coverage if they stayed with the company for at least 17 years.
The proposed class action, docketed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, challenges Cabell Huntington’s plans to terminate welfare benefits for non-union retirees in September. Plaintiffs Martha Blenko and Laura Mullarky say the company repeatedly informed them both verbally and in writing that these benefits would continue for the remainder of their lifetimes, which ...

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — After a week of stalled contract negotiations between Cabell Huntington Hospital and SEIU District 1199, both parties say they will return to the bargaining table Nov. 30.
Sherri McKinney (Twitter)
“We’re cautiously optimistic,” the union’s regional director Sherri McKinney told MetroNews.
A federal mediator made the announcement Tuesday during a hearing in Cabell County Circuit Court over the hospital’s temporary restraining order for the ongoing worker strike.
Judge Chris Chiles decided to keep the TRO in place and to revisit it Dec. 10. The order is meant to reduce disruptions on the picket line.
Nearly 900 maintenance and service employees have been on strike since Nov. 3 over wage increases, better staffing conditions and continued health insurance coverage within their contract.
The hospital made a counter offer earlier this month, but union leaders rejected it.
“We did, in good faith, change our offer when we went back to the table when the strike had commenced and what we got was a worse offer, so we’re not falling for any of it,” McKinney said.
Molly Frick, director of human resources at CHH, said they are hoping the union “will make a serious offer” when negotiations resume.
“All we have asked from the beginning is that members of the Union’s service unit start making a reasonable contribution to their healthcare premiums,” Frick said in a statement.
Frick said they have asked union members to contribute, on average, less than 5 percent of the total cost of providing healthcare for employees’ and their dependents.
“The premium rates are affordable, and our service workers earn a good living and are paid at the top of the market, with an average base rate of $21.61 per hour and an average hourly rate of $26.45, including shift differential and various premium pay. It is our sincere hope that the union will begin to bargain in good faith over the hospital’s health care proposal,” Frick said.
McKinney said the hospital is offering a 10 percent cut in wages that their members can’t afford.
“They need to stop committing unfair labor practices and a proposal that takes 10 percent of people’s wages away, we’re going to be in the same situation,” McKinney said.
During Monday’s Huntington City Council meeting, two of the striking union members urged the council to vote in favor of a resolution to support their efforts in asking for a fair contract.
McKinney said their plan is to continue manning the picket line through the Thanksgiving holiday.
“It will be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week just the same as we have. People sign up for six hour shifts, not just on the holiday, but on every day,” she said.

A federal judge granted preliminary approval Aug. 10 of a $5.7 million settlement between Huntington, W.Va.-based Cabell Huntington Hospital and 211 retirees who accused the provider of reneging on healthcare benefit promises. 
The class-action lawsuit alleged that the hospital violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by moving to terminate nonunion retirees' benefits despite promises that it would help fund their healthcare for life. The hospital allegedly told workers that they could retire at 62 and collect lifelong benefits if they retired as nonunion employees.
Both the hospital and the retirees asked the judge in July to approve the settlement. The hospital denies the retirees' claims, but agreed to the settlement, according to court records.

MARTHA BLENKO and LAURA MULLARKY, and JANE DOE, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL, INC., Defendant.
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Pending before the Court is the Parties' Joint Motion to Certify Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice. ECF No. 62. The Plaintiffs move the Court to certify a class defined as follows: 211 non-union retirees from Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. who received notification in 2021 of a curtailment or termination in their retiree health benefits. The Parties agreed to settle this matter pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) regarding Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendant's agents made material misrepresentations in substantially the same form to all Affected Individuals, indicating that the Hospital would provide cost-free retiree health insurance for Pre-65 retirees, and Medicare supplemental benefits thereafter throughout the lives of retirees. Defendant denies these allegations but nonetheless agrees to this class action settlement. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS this Motion. ECF No. 62.
BACKGROUND
This case arises out of Cabell Huntington Hospital's (Defendant) decision to amend its retiree healthcare benefits plan. Defendant served as administrator of all the employee welfare benefit plans and, in this role, operated a unified health and welfare plan for active workers and retirees from 1955 through 2019, which was called Plan 501. This Plan was not formally recorded in writing until 2013. Once Plan 501 was written in a formal document, this Plan contained what is known as “Reservation of Right” language, which stated that, although Defendant planned to continue the Plan indefinitely, it reserved the right to amend, modify, change, or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason. See ECF No. 14-3 § 6.1. Further, the Plan indicated that Defendant did not “guarantee the continuation of any Benefits during employment or after termination thereof.” Id. § 6.2. Defendant claimed that the only Plan document for the 501 Plan was both the Plan document and the Plan's Summary Plan Document (SPD). Defendant was statutorily obligated to distribute an SPD for the Plan, but it is undisputed that Defendants never distributed any SPD. Since the beginning of Plaintiffs' employment with Defendant, Plaintiffs allege Defendant's human resources staff repeatedly informed Plaintiffs and co-workers that Defendant would pay premiums for retiree welfare benefits through Plaintiffs' lifetimes once they had met the conditions for retirement. Defendant's staff also informed Plaintiffs that retiree spouses would receive health insurance under Defendant's welfare benefits plan until the spouses reached the age of 65. Plaintiffs allege that, prior to the January 2021 letter, they were not informed of Defendant's right to terminate retiree welfare benefits.
In 2019, Defendant adopted a new “wrap” welfare benefit plan referred to as the 506 Plan. This Plan provided that:
The cost of the benefits provided through the Component Benefit Plans may be funded in part by Employer contributions and in part by Employee contributions.... Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. will determine and periodically communicate the Employee's share of
the cost of the benefits provided through each Component Benefit Plan, and it may change that determination at any time. The Employer will make its contributions in an amount that in Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc.'s sole discretion determines is at least sufficient to fund the benefits or a portion of the benefits that are not otherwise funded by Employee contributions...
ECF No. 23-3 § 2.6. The plan also contained right to amend and right to terminate language. Id. §§ 5.1, 5.3. A separate SPD document for the 506 Plan contained the right to terminate and right to amend language. ECF No. 14-19, at 28. Although this document was made available to employees at any time, as Defendant posted it online, this document was never distributed by Defendant to Plan participants and beneficiaries as required by statute. Plaintiffs were informed that the Plan was available to them upon request or online.
In October of 2019, Defendant distributed to employees and retirees an open enrollment guide for insurance coverage with respect to the 506 Plan. See ECF Nos. 23-1, 23-4. These guides contained the language that Defendant reserved the right to amend or terminate the Plan and informed participants to look to official Plan documents for complete information regarding benefits. See id. This document also explained that the descriptions of the Plan were not guarantees of any benefit coverage.
In 2021, Defendant decided to terminate the retiree welfare benefits. A letter was sent to retirees on January 28, 2021, which announced that, effective March 31, 2021, Post-65 retirees would no longer have coverage under the Plan and that Pre-65 retirees would be charged a premium to cover a portion of the cost of coverage under the Plan if they chose to remain enrolled. This coverage would terminate for the Pre-65 group once they turned 65 or first became Medicare eligible. On February 12, 2021, Defendant issued a letter to Post-65 retirees informing them that Defendant would extend benefits through May 31, 2021. On March 8, 2021, Defendant issued a letter to Pre-65 retirees extending their benefits to June 30, 2021.
Defendants next issued a letter to retirees in April 2021 which extended Post-65 benefit coverage through September 30, 2021, and moving forward, offered to retirees to deposit $250 a month into a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) to pay for retirees' healthcare. However, this letter, unlike the others, informed the retirees that Defendant reserved right to terminate the benefits under the Plan at any time. Additionally, Defendant issued to Pre-65 retirees a letter that it would pay for these retirees' medical and prescription benefits through the end of June, and that effective July 1, 2021, retirees would have to pay a portion of their premium for their medical and prescription drug healthcare.
After the commencement of the current lawsuit, Defendant once again extended benefits to Pre-65 retirees through October 1, 2021. On August 13, 2021, Defendant issued a letter notifying Pre-65 retirees that if they wished to enroll in a lower-cost high-risk plan, they would have to take action by September 7, 2021. On August 20, 2021, a letter was sent to Post-65 retirees which reiterated that Defendant would terminate retirees Medicare supplement on September 30 and informed retirees that they could join an information session to learn how to use the HRA.
The Parties participated in mediation on May 24, 2022, and reached a settlement agreement in this matter. The proposed settlement totals $5,694,500. The Parties filed this Motion to Certify Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice on July 8, 2022. ECF No. 62.
LEGAL STANDARD
a. Class certification
Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establishes four class certification requirements: (1) a class so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) a representative party whose claims and defenses are typical of the class's claims and defenses; and (4) a representative party that will fairly and adequately protect the class's interests. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, 579 F.3d 380, 384 (4th Cir. 2009). In addition to these four requirements, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the proposed class action fits into one of three forms permitted by Rule 23(b). See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 163 (1974). The parties here have agreed to request conditional certification under Rule 23(b)(3). This Rule states that a class may be certified when:
the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:
(A) The class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
(B) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular form; and
(D) The likely difficulties in managing a class action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)-(D). To warrant certification under Rule 23(b)(3), “[i]ssues common to the class must predominate over individual issues, and the class action device must be superior to other means of handling the litigation.” Gates v. Rohm & Hass Co., 248 F.R.D. 434, 442-43 (E.D. Pa. 2008).
b. Class settlement
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that a class action shall not be dismissed without the approval of the court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). Rule 23(e)'s primary concern is protection of class members whose rights may not have been adequately considered during settlement negotiations. In re Jiffy Lube Sec. Litig., 927 F.2d 155 (4th Cir. 1991). Approval of class action settlements is committed to “the sound discretion of the district courts to appraise the reasonableness of particular class-action settlements on a case-by-case basis, in light of the relevant circumstances.” Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 742 (1986).
If a proposed settlement will bind class members, as it will here, Rule 23(e)(1) states the court may approve the settlement proposal “only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). Courts generally follow a two-step procedure for approving class action settlements that will bind absent class members. Horton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 855 F.Supp. 825, 827 (E.D. N.C. 1994). First, the Court preliminarily reviews the proposed settlement to determine if it “‘is within the range of possible approval, or in other words, whether there is probable cause to notify the class of the proposed settlement.” Id. (citations and internal quotations omitted). Once the Court grants preliminary approval and notice is sent to the class, the court conducts a fairness hearing to determine if the proposed settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” under Rule 23(e). Id. (citations omitted). Before granting final settlement approval, the court must also determine that class members were given reasonable notice of the settlement. See Domonoske v. Bank of America, 790 F.Supp.2d 466, 472 (W.D. Va. 2011) (citation omitted).
Rule 23 requires that, for a proposed settlement to be approved, the Court must consider whether:
(A) The class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class;
(B) The proposal was negotiated at arm's length;
(C) The relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account:
(i) The costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal;
(ii) The effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims;
(iii) The terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of payment; and
(iv) Any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and
(D) The proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).
c. Class notice
“In the context of a class action, the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment require ‘[r]easonable notice combined with an opportunity to be heard and withdraw from the class.'” Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06-00612, 2010 WL 1734869, at *3 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (quoting In re Serzone Prods. Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. 221, 231 (S.D. W.Va. 2005)). In Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, the Supreme Court held that due process is satisfied “where a fully descriptive notice is sent first-class mail to each class member, with an explanation of the right to opt out[.]” 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Rule 23(c)(2)(B), which applies to this class certified under 23(b)(3), requires that class members receive “the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B). Rule 23(c)(2)(B) further provides:
The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language: (i) the nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified; (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires; (v) that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion; (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).
Id.
DISCUSSION
The Parties have agreed to a settlement, totaling $5,694,500. The Parties ask the Court to approve of both the certification of the class for settlement purposes and to approve of the class settlement and notice.
a. Class certification for settlement purposes is appropriate under Rule 23
There is one central dispute in this case regarding a retiree healthcare benefit plan. The parties agree that the Rule 23(a) requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation have been met. They also purport that this matter falls within Rule 23(b)(3), as the class wide settlement provides a uniform resolution to the common claims in this matter regarding the same healthcare benefit plan.
1. Numerosity
The proposed class includes 211 non-union retirees from Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. who received notification in 2021 of a curtailment or termination in their retiree health benefits. These class members reside across several southern counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, and potentially other adjacent states. There is no “mechanical test” or minimum class size requirement, but courts have generally found numerosity present when a class has 40 or more members. Baxley v. Jividen, 338 F.R.D. 80, 86 (S.D. W.Va. 2020) (citing Holsey v. Armour & Co., 734 F.2d 199, 217 (4th Cir. 1984)). The joinder of over 200 class members would be impracticable; thus, the numerosity requirement is met.
2. Commonality
Although “[a] single common question will suffice, . . . it must be of such a nature that its determination ‘will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.'” EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 360 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)). The claims of the members of the proposed class share common facts and legal issues, as they arise out of Defendant's termination of the retirement medical benefits for the proposed class. While the individual circumstances of each proposed class member may differ slightly, the claims still involve the same actions by Defendant and involve the same legal theories. See Christman v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 92 F.R.D. 441, 452 n.28 (N.D. W.Va. 1981) (“When the claim arises out of the same legal or remedial theory, the presence of factual variations is normally not sufficient to preclude class action treatment.”) By certifying the class, the Court may resolve the questions of fact and law that are common to all of the proposed class members. Commonality has been met.
3. Typicality
Federal Rule 23 requires that “the claims... of the representative parties are typical of the claims... of the class.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). To meet the typicality requirement, the proposed class representatives must show that “the claims or defenses of the class and class representatives arise from the same event or pattern or practice and are based on the same legal theory.” In re Serzone Prods. Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. 221, 238 (S.D. W.Va. 2005) (quotations omitted). Here, the Parties represent that the claims and defenses of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the proposed class members because all proposed class members are similarly affected by Defendant's the termination of the retirees' healthcare benefits-this injury is suffered by Plaintiffs and is suffered by all members of the proposed class members. Thus, the typicality requirement is met.
4. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the proposed class
The class representatives must “fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). The counsel representing the class must also be capable of “fairly and adequately” representing the interest of the class. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g). This analysis takes into consideration “(1) whether there is conflict between the representatives and class members, and (2) whether the representatives will vigorously prosecute the matter on behalf of the class.” Baxley, 338 F.R.D. at *89 (internal quotations omitted).
The Parties represent that the named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the proposed class members, as there are no conflicts of interest between the named Plaintiffs and any proposed class members, and the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated their commitment to pursuing their rights. Plaintiffs' interests are clearly aligned with the proposed class members, as they have a common interest in these claims.
Plaintiffs' counsel will also fairly and adequately represent the issues of the proposed class. The attorneys that represent Plaintiffs are Sam B. Petsonk, of Petsonk PLLC, and Bren Pomponio and Laura Davidson of Mountain State Justice, Inc. Courts in the Southern District of West Virginia have found both these firms to be well-qualified to act as class counsel in complex employment matters. See e.g., Shawn Abner, et al. v. Blackjewel L.L.C., et al., Case 3:19-ap-03003 (Order Approving Class Certification and Settlement - ECF 100) (May 5, 2021); Michael Ray v. Double Bonus Coal Co., et al., Case 5:15-cv-03014 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 42) (May 3, 2016); David Jordan v. Dynamic Energy, Inc., et al., case 5:16-cv-04413 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 43) (May 29, 2018); Frank G. Treadway v. Bluestone Coal Corp, et al., Case 5:16-cv-12149 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 25) (May 5, 2018); Dougie Lester v. Pay Car Mining, Inc., et al., Case 5:17-cv-00740 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 40) (June 6, 2018). Proposed class counsel also participated in a trial in the Southern District of West Virginia litigating ERISA claims. See Fitzwater, et al. v. CONSOL Energy Inc., No. 2:16-cv-09849, 2020 WL 3620078 (S.D. W.Va. July 2, 2020). Plaintiffs' counsel have demonstrated their experience in representing complex ERISA cases and serve as fair and adequate class counsel.
5. Rule 23(b)(3)
Certification is proper under Rule 23(b)(3) when “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and... class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently” adjudicating those claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b). The Parties represent that this class is appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(3) because the evidence necessary to prove and to demonstrate the appropriate relief for the class claim is identical for Plaintiffs and all proposed class members. The Court must consider:
(A) The class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
(B) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular form; and
(D) The likely difficulties in managing a class action.
Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Plaintiffs' claims here arise from questions of law and facts that are common to all proposed class members. These questions and facts predominate over any potential individual proposed class members' factual questions. Further, because joinder is impractical, and to promote judicial efficiency and economy, class action is an appropriate method of adjudicating this matter.
Thus, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Certify Class. ECF No. 62.
b. Class settlement
The Parties assert that the Court should approve of the settlement because it is fair to the class and that class counsel will provide adequate notice to the proposed class members. Rule 23(e) requires that a Court may approve of a binding class settlement only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e).
The Parties assert that the settlement terms are fair to the class because: 1) the Parties mediated at arms' length before Magistrate Judge Eifert; 2) the Plaintiffs completed class discovery; 3) class counsel are experienced in similar litigation; and 4) the number of objectors is anticipated to be minimal.
The Parties provided a copy of the Mediation Agreement (ECF No. 62-1) and also summarized the structure of the settlement:
• Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)
o Designed to last for a period of at least six years o Unallocated funds in an individual HRA upon the death of the account holder, the sums will revert to the High-Risk Fund following the death of each such individual account holder and the full payment of covered costs to the estate of the deceased for all costs that were incurred prior to the holder's death o Individual HRA may be used for any expense covered by Medicare Part B or D, and individual accounts may be used for medical, dental, vision, hearing aids, or pharmaceutical costs for the treatment of a class member, their spouse, or dependents
• High-Risk Fund o Replicates the last-dollar or “Cadillac” Medicare supplement that the Defendant provided to its retirees o Gives class members the option to recover funds to pay for significant pharmaceutical costs not covered by the Medicare supplement, such as costs of specialty drugs or items that fall within the “donut hole”
o Provides only for expenses that are: a) covered under Medicare Part D, b) incurred for the treatment of a class member, and c) not paid for by class member's Part D Plan (members must have a Part D plan to submit expenses for reimbursement from the High Risk Fund, must submit the bill to the settlement administrator with an explanation of benefits or other proof of rejection of coverage by the class member's Part D Plan)
o Per capita lifetime cap of $10,000 per class member
• Class Administration o Walters Administration has been secured to review bids for providing the HRA and administering the High-Risk Fund. This arrangement entails a one-time fee without any additional “trailing fees” that come out of individual class members accounts o Wesbanco Bank will be the placeholder of all accounts and will administer reimbursements along with the class administrator (Walters Administration)
o Chris Walters of Walters Administration will be a co-signer on all accounts at Wesbanco and will approve all payments o Reimbursements for expenses submitted to the settlement accounts will be released weekly o Class members will have withdrawal power from any of their accounts for approved reimbursements for covered medical expenses
• Class Representative Service Fee o The three Class Representatives will receive service fees of $15,000 each for performing important services for the benefit of the class by commencing litigation
The Parties assert that this settlement represents strong value for the proposed class. There are 211 proposed class members of eligible retirees who were affected by the challenged actions regarding the retiree benefit plan. The settlement's Common Fund equals $4,974,500. The proposed attorney fee in the settlement is 20% of the Common Fund, or $994,900, to be distributed at the time the settlement is fully funded by Defendant, leaving $3,979,600 in the Common Fund. Divided between the 211 proposed class members, this totals $18,860.66 per class member. Without the settlement, the class members receive $250/month in the HRA, or $3,000 a year, subject to Defendant's right to terminate all payments at any time. The settlement amount represents over six years future benefits, in addition to coverage through the High-Risk Fund.
The Court finds that the class representatives and counsel have adequately represented the interests of the class, as noted in the discussion on class certification. The proposed settlement was negotiated and agreed upon at arm's length before Magistrate Judge Eifert, avoiding the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal. Further, the settlement provides detailed and efficient proposed methods of distributing HRA funds to the proposed settlement class as well as fair terms for proposed attorney's fees. This settlement certainly benefits the proposed class members equally. The proposed class currently risk losing benefits under Defendant's right to terminate payments and currently have no High-Risk Fund benefit. This settlement gives the proposed settlement class over six years of benefits and access to the High-Risk Fund. Thus, the Court preliminarily approves of this settlement.
c. Proposed class notice is appropriate
Rule 23(c)(2)(B) requires that the proposed class receive the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B). The Parties here propose two rounds of individualized class notice by U.S. Mail. The first round will notify the class of certification and proposed settlement, enabling objections or opting out, and noticing the fairness hearing. The second round will inform the class as to whether the Court has approved the final settlement agreement and how they can retrieve and utilize their settlement payments. A sixty-day period for notice is proposed as a customary and reasonable amount of time to unsure due consideration and opportunity to opt out. The proposed class notice submitted by the Parties (ECF No. 62-3). The Court FINDS that this notice properly informs the class members of the nature of the action, the definition of the certified class, the claims and issues in this matter, the option to appear at the hearing, the option to be excluded from the class, and the binding effect of the class settlement.
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Certify the Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice. ECF No. 62.
A Final Approval Hearing shall be held on October 31, 2022, at 1:30 P.M., before the Court in Huntington, West Virginia to consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and should be given final approval. The date or time of the hearing may be changed without further notice to the Settlement Class.
The notice must be sent to the proposed class on or before 14 days after the entry of this Order.
Any class member who objects to the settlement will have 60 days to notify the Clerk of the Court of their objection.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — Cabell Huntington Hospital workers filled Huntington City Council's chambers Monday night, but council members decided not to back a resolutionin the labor dispute.
Service and maintenance workers at the hospital have now been on strike for 20 days. Councilman Bob Bailey said council needed to support all union workers and wrote a resolution for both Cabell Huntington Hospital and Special Metals to come back to the bargaining table. Special Metals workers have also been on strike for almost three months.
Bailey's resolution was killed.
Councilman Pat Jones called for the two institutions to come up with a solution to get their employees back to work. He said if that didn't happen in the next two weeks, he will introduce a resolution.
Council members also voted to create a new deputy chief position inside the Huntington Police Department. The person in the new position will help with community policing and recruitment.
Right now, the vote only approves the position and it's up to Mayor Steve Williams to appoint an officer. Williams is expected to appoint Lt. Phil Watkins.
Council members also gave the Cabell Huntington Health Department approval to continue its needle exchange program. Enforcement by the local government is just one part of West Virginia's new law that requires harm reduction programs to get a license. Williams called the health department's program essential and a "no brainer" to support.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

Two retired hospital workers filed a federal lawsuit accusing West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital of terminating retiree health coverage after repeatedly telling non-union workers they would receive lifetime coverage if they stayed with the company for at least 17 years.
The proposed class action, docketed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, challenges Cabell Huntington’s plans to terminate welfare benefits for non-union retirees in September. Plaintiffs Martha Blenko and Laura Mullarky say the company repeatedly informed them both verbally and in writing that these benefits would continue for the remainder of their lifetimes, which ...

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — After a week of stalled contract negotiations between Cabell Huntington Hospital and SEIU District 1199, both parties say they will return to the bargaining table Nov. 30.
Sherri McKinney (Twitter)
“We’re cautiously optimistic,” the union’s regional director Sherri McKinney told MetroNews.
A federal mediator made the announcement Tuesday during a hearing in Cabell County Circuit Court over the hospital’s temporary restraining order for the ongoing worker strike.
Judge Chris Chiles decided to keep the TRO in place and to revisit it Dec. 10. The order is meant to reduce disruptions on the picket line.
Nearly 900 maintenance and service employees have been on strike since Nov. 3 over wage increases, better staffing conditions and continued health insurance coverage within their contract.
The hospital made a counter offer earlier this month, but union leaders rejected it.
“We did, in good faith, change our offer when we went back to the table when the strike had commenced and what we got was a worse offer, so we’re not falling for any of it,” McKinney said.
Molly Frick, director of human resources at CHH, said they are hoping the union “will make a serious offer” when negotiations resume.
“All we have asked from the beginning is that members of the Union’s service unit start making a reasonable contribution to their healthcare premiums,” Frick said in a statement.
Frick said they have asked union members to contribute, on average, less than 5 percent of the total cost of providing healthcare for employees’ and their dependents.
“The premium rates are affordable, and our service workers earn a good living and are paid at the top of the market, with an average base rate of $21.61 per hour and an average hourly rate of $26.45, including shift differential and various premium pay. It is our sincere hope that the union will begin to bargain in good faith over the hospital’s health care proposal,” Frick said.
McKinney said the hospital is offering a 10 percent cut in wages that their members can’t afford.
“They need to stop committing unfair labor practices and a proposal that takes 10 percent of people’s wages away, we’re going to be in the same situation,” McKinney said.
During Monday’s Huntington City Council meeting, two of the striking union members urged the council to vote in favor of a resolution to support their efforts in asking for a fair contract.
McKinney said their plan is to continue manning the picket line through the Thanksgiving holiday.
“It will be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week just the same as we have. People sign up for six hour shifts, not just on the holiday, but on every day,” she said.

A federal judge granted preliminary approval Aug. 10 of a $5.7 million settlement between Huntington, W.Va.-based Cabell Huntington Hospital and 211 retirees who accused the provider of reneging on healthcare benefit promises. 
The class-action lawsuit alleged that the hospital violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by moving to terminate nonunion retirees' benefits despite promises that it would help fund their healthcare for life. The hospital allegedly told workers that they could retire at 62 and collect lifelong benefits if they retired as nonunion employees.
Both the hospital and the retirees asked the judge in July to approve the settlement. The hospital denies the retirees' claims, but agreed to the settlement, according to court records.

MARTHA BLENKO and LAURA MULLARKY, and JANE DOE, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL, INC., Defendant.
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Pending before the Court is the Parties' Joint Motion to Certify Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice. ECF No. 62. The Plaintiffs move the Court to certify a class defined as follows: 211 non-union retirees from Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. who received notification in 2021 of a curtailment or termination in their retiree health benefits. The Parties agreed to settle this matter pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) regarding Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendant's agents made material misrepresentations in substantially the same form to all Affected Individuals, indicating that the Hospital would provide cost-free retiree health insurance for Pre-65 retirees, and Medicare supplemental benefits thereafter throughout the lives of retirees. Defendant denies these allegations but nonetheless agrees to this class action settlement. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS this Motion. ECF No. 62.
BACKGROUND
This case arises out of Cabell Huntington Hospital's (Defendant) decision to amend its retiree healthcare benefits plan. Defendant served as administrator of all the employee welfare benefit plans and, in this role, operated a unified health and welfare plan for active workers and retirees from 1955 through 2019, which was called Plan 501. This Plan was not formally recorded in writing until 2013. Once Plan 501 was written in a formal document, this Plan contained what is known as “Reservation of Right” language, which stated that, although Defendant planned to continue the Plan indefinitely, it reserved the right to amend, modify, change, or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason. See ECF No. 14-3 § 6.1. Further, the Plan indicated that Defendant did not “guarantee the continuation of any Benefits during employment or after termination thereof.” Id. § 6.2. Defendant claimed that the only Plan document for the 501 Plan was both the Plan document and the Plan's Summary Plan Document (SPD). Defendant was statutorily obligated to distribute an SPD for the Plan, but it is undisputed that Defendants never distributed any SPD. Since the beginning of Plaintiffs' employment with Defendant, Plaintiffs allege Defendant's human resources staff repeatedly informed Plaintiffs and co-workers that Defendant would pay premiums for retiree welfare benefits through Plaintiffs' lifetimes once they had met the conditions for retirement. Defendant's staff also informed Plaintiffs that retiree spouses would receive health insurance under Defendant's welfare benefits plan until the spouses reached the age of 65. Plaintiffs allege that, prior to the January 2021 letter, they were not informed of Defendant's right to terminate retiree welfare benefits.
In 2019, Defendant adopted a new “wrap” welfare benefit plan referred to as the 506 Plan. This Plan provided that:
The cost of the benefits provided through the Component Benefit Plans may be funded in part by Employer contributions and in part by Employee contributions.... Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. will determine and periodically communicate the Employee's share of
the cost of the benefits provided through each Component Benefit Plan, and it may change that determination at any time. The Employer will make its contributions in an amount that in Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc.'s sole discretion determines is at least sufficient to fund the benefits or a portion of the benefits that are not otherwise funded by Employee contributions...
ECF No. 23-3 § 2.6. The plan also contained right to amend and right to terminate language. Id. §§ 5.1, 5.3. A separate SPD document for the 506 Plan contained the right to terminate and right to amend language. ECF No. 14-19, at 28. Although this document was made available to employees at any time, as Defendant posted it online, this document was never distributed by Defendant to Plan participants and beneficiaries as required by statute. Plaintiffs were informed that the Plan was available to them upon request or online.
In October of 2019, Defendant distributed to employees and retirees an open enrollment guide for insurance coverage with respect to the 506 Plan. See ECF Nos. 23-1, 23-4. These guides contained the language that Defendant reserved the right to amend or terminate the Plan and informed participants to look to official Plan documents for complete information regarding benefits. See id. This document also explained that the descriptions of the Plan were not guarantees of any benefit coverage.
In 2021, Defendant decided to terminate the retiree welfare benefits. A letter was sent to retirees on January 28, 2021, which announced that, effective March 31, 2021, Post-65 retirees would no longer have coverage under the Plan and that Pre-65 retirees would be charged a premium to cover a portion of the cost of coverage under the Plan if they chose to remain enrolled. This coverage would terminate for the Pre-65 group once they turned 65 or first became Medicare eligible. On February 12, 2021, Defendant issued a letter to Post-65 retirees informing them that Defendant would extend benefits through May 31, 2021. On March 8, 2021, Defendant issued a letter to Pre-65 retirees extending their benefits to June 30, 2021.
Defendants next issued a letter to retirees in April 2021 which extended Post-65 benefit coverage through September 30, 2021, and moving forward, offered to retirees to deposit $250 a month into a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) to pay for retirees' healthcare. However, this letter, unlike the others, informed the retirees that Defendant reserved right to terminate the benefits under the Plan at any time. Additionally, Defendant issued to Pre-65 retirees a letter that it would pay for these retirees' medical and prescription benefits through the end of June, and that effective July 1, 2021, retirees would have to pay a portion of their premium for their medical and prescription drug healthcare.
After the commencement of the current lawsuit, Defendant once again extended benefits to Pre-65 retirees through October 1, 2021. On August 13, 2021, Defendant issued a letter notifying Pre-65 retirees that if they wished to enroll in a lower-cost high-risk plan, they would have to take action by September 7, 2021. On August 20, 2021, a letter was sent to Post-65 retirees which reiterated that Defendant would terminate retirees Medicare supplement on September 30 and informed retirees that they could join an information session to learn how to use the HRA.
The Parties participated in mediation on May 24, 2022, and reached a settlement agreement in this matter. The proposed settlement totals $5,694,500. The Parties filed this Motion to Certify Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice on July 8, 2022. ECF No. 62.
LEGAL STANDARD
a. Class certification
Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establishes four class certification requirements: (1) a class so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) a representative party whose claims and defenses are typical of the class's claims and defenses; and (4) a representative party that will fairly and adequately protect the class's interests. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, 579 F.3d 380, 384 (4th Cir. 2009). In addition to these four requirements, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the proposed class action fits into one of three forms permitted by Rule 23(b). See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 163 (1974). The parties here have agreed to request conditional certification under Rule 23(b)(3). This Rule states that a class may be certified when:
the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:
(A) The class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
(B) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular form; and
(D) The likely difficulties in managing a class action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)-(D). To warrant certification under Rule 23(b)(3), “[i]ssues common to the class must predominate over individual issues, and the class action device must be superior to other means of handling the litigation.” Gates v. Rohm & Hass Co., 248 F.R.D. 434, 442-43 (E.D. Pa. 2008).
b. Class settlement
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that a class action shall not be dismissed without the approval of the court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). Rule 23(e)'s primary concern is protection of class members whose rights may not have been adequately considered during settlement negotiations. In re Jiffy Lube Sec. Litig., 927 F.2d 155 (4th Cir. 1991). Approval of class action settlements is committed to “the sound discretion of the district courts to appraise the reasonableness of particular class-action settlements on a case-by-case basis, in light of the relevant circumstances.” Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 742 (1986).
If a proposed settlement will bind class members, as it will here, Rule 23(e)(1) states the court may approve the settlement proposal “only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). Courts generally follow a two-step procedure for approving class action settlements that will bind absent class members. Horton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 855 F.Supp. 825, 827 (E.D. N.C. 1994). First, the Court preliminarily reviews the proposed settlement to determine if it “‘is within the range of possible approval, or in other words, whether there is probable cause to notify the class of the proposed settlement.” Id. (citations and internal quotations omitted). Once the Court grants preliminary approval and notice is sent to the class, the court conducts a fairness hearing to determine if the proposed settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” under Rule 23(e). Id. (citations omitted). Before granting final settlement approval, the court must also determine that class members were given reasonable notice of the settlement. See Domonoske v. Bank of America, 790 F.Supp.2d 466, 472 (W.D. Va. 2011) (citation omitted).
Rule 23 requires that, for a proposed settlement to be approved, the Court must consider whether:
(A) The class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class;
(B) The proposal was negotiated at arm's length;
(C) The relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account:
(i) The costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal;
(ii) The effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims;
(iii) The terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of payment; and
(iv) Any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and
(D) The proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).
c. Class notice
“In the context of a class action, the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment require ‘[r]easonable notice combined with an opportunity to be heard and withdraw from the class.'” Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06-00612, 2010 WL 1734869, at *3 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (quoting In re Serzone Prods. Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. 221, 231 (S.D. W.Va. 2005)). In Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, the Supreme Court held that due process is satisfied “where a fully descriptive notice is sent first-class mail to each class member, with an explanation of the right to opt out[.]” 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Rule 23(c)(2)(B), which applies to this class certified under 23(b)(3), requires that class members receive “the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B). Rule 23(c)(2)(B) further provides:
The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language: (i) the nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified; (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires; (v) that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion; (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).
Id.
DISCUSSION
The Parties have agreed to a settlement, totaling $5,694,500. The Parties ask the Court to approve of both the certification of the class for settlement purposes and to approve of the class settlement and notice.
a. Class certification for settlement purposes is appropriate under Rule 23
There is one central dispute in this case regarding a retiree healthcare benefit plan. The parties agree that the Rule 23(a) requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation have been met. They also purport that this matter falls within Rule 23(b)(3), as the class wide settlement provides a uniform resolution to the common claims in this matter regarding the same healthcare benefit plan.
1. Numerosity
The proposed class includes 211 non-union retirees from Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. who received notification in 2021 of a curtailment or termination in their retiree health benefits. These class members reside across several southern counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, and potentially other adjacent states. There is no “mechanical test” or minimum class size requirement, but courts have generally found numerosity present when a class has 40 or more members. Baxley v. Jividen, 338 F.R.D. 80, 86 (S.D. W.Va. 2020) (citing Holsey v. Armour & Co., 734 F.2d 199, 217 (4th Cir. 1984)). The joinder of over 200 class members would be impracticable; thus, the numerosity requirement is met.
2. Commonality
Although “[a] single common question will suffice, . . . it must be of such a nature that its determination ‘will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.'” EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 360 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)). The claims of the members of the proposed class share common facts and legal issues, as they arise out of Defendant's termination of the retirement medical benefits for the proposed class. While the individual circumstances of each proposed class member may differ slightly, the claims still involve the same actions by Defendant and involve the same legal theories. See Christman v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 92 F.R.D. 441, 452 n.28 (N.D. W.Va. 1981) (“When the claim arises out of the same legal or remedial theory, the presence of factual variations is normally not sufficient to preclude class action treatment.”) By certifying the class, the Court may resolve the questions of fact and law that are common to all of the proposed class members. Commonality has been met.
3. Typicality
Federal Rule 23 requires that “the claims... of the representative parties are typical of the claims... of the class.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). To meet the typicality requirement, the proposed class representatives must show that “the claims or defenses of the class and class representatives arise from the same event or pattern or practice and are based on the same legal theory.” In re Serzone Prods. Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. 221, 238 (S.D. W.Va. 2005) (quotations omitted). Here, the Parties represent that the claims and defenses of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the proposed class members because all proposed class members are similarly affected by Defendant's the termination of the retirees' healthcare benefits-this injury is suffered by Plaintiffs and is suffered by all members of the proposed class members. Thus, the typicality requirement is met.
4. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the proposed class
The class representatives must “fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). The counsel representing the class must also be capable of “fairly and adequately” representing the interest of the class. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g). This analysis takes into consideration “(1) whether there is conflict between the representatives and class members, and (2) whether the representatives will vigorously prosecute the matter on behalf of the class.” Baxley, 338 F.R.D. at *89 (internal quotations omitted).
The Parties represent that the named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the proposed class members, as there are no conflicts of interest between the named Plaintiffs and any proposed class members, and the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated their commitment to pursuing their rights. Plaintiffs' interests are clearly aligned with the proposed class members, as they have a common interest in these claims.
Plaintiffs' counsel will also fairly and adequately represent the issues of the proposed class. The attorneys that represent Plaintiffs are Sam B. Petsonk, of Petsonk PLLC, and Bren Pomponio and Laura Davidson of Mountain State Justice, Inc. Courts in the Southern District of West Virginia have found both these firms to be well-qualified to act as class counsel in complex employment matters. See e.g., Shawn Abner, et al. v. Blackjewel L.L.C., et al., Case 3:19-ap-03003 (Order Approving Class Certification and Settlement - ECF 100) (May 5, 2021); Michael Ray v. Double Bonus Coal Co., et al., Case 5:15-cv-03014 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 42) (May 3, 2016); David Jordan v. Dynamic Energy, Inc., et al., case 5:16-cv-04413 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 43) (May 29, 2018); Frank G. Treadway v. Bluestone Coal Corp, et al., Case 5:16-cv-12149 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 25) (May 5, 2018); Dougie Lester v. Pay Car Mining, Inc., et al., Case 5:17-cv-00740 (Order Certifying Class - ECF 40) (June 6, 2018). Proposed class counsel also participated in a trial in the Southern District of West Virginia litigating ERISA claims. See Fitzwater, et al. v. CONSOL Energy Inc., No. 2:16-cv-09849, 2020 WL 3620078 (S.D. W.Va. July 2, 2020). Plaintiffs' counsel have demonstrated their experience in representing complex ERISA cases and serve as fair and adequate class counsel.
5. Rule 23(b)(3)
Certification is proper under Rule 23(b)(3) when “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and... class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently” adjudicating those claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b). The Parties represent that this class is appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(3) because the evidence necessary to prove and to demonstrate the appropriate relief for the class claim is identical for Plaintiffs and all proposed class members. The Court must consider:
(A) The class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
(B) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular form; and
(D) The likely difficulties in managing a class action.
Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Plaintiffs' claims here arise from questions of law and facts that are common to all proposed class members. These questions and facts predominate over any potential individual proposed class members' factual questions. Further, because joinder is impractical, and to promote judicial efficiency and economy, class action is an appropriate method of adjudicating this matter.
Thus, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Certify Class. ECF No. 62.
b. Class settlement
The Parties assert that the Court should approve of the settlement because it is fair to the class and that class counsel will provide adequate notice to the proposed class members. Rule 23(e) requires that a Court may approve of a binding class settlement only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e).
The Parties assert that the settlement terms are fair to the class because: 1) the Parties mediated at arms' length before Magistrate Judge Eifert; 2) the Plaintiffs completed class discovery; 3) class counsel are experienced in similar litigation; and 4) the number of objectors is anticipated to be minimal.
The Parties provided a copy of the Mediation Agreement (ECF No. 62-1) and also summarized the structure of the settlement:
• Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)
o Designed to last for a period of at least six years o Unallocated funds in an individual HRA upon the death of the account holder, the sums will revert to the High-Risk Fund following the death of each such individual account holder and the full payment of covered costs to the estate of the deceased for all costs that were incurred prior to the holder's death o Individual HRA may be used for any expense covered by Medicare Part B or D, and individual accounts may be used for medical, dental, vision, hearing aids, or pharmaceutical costs for the treatment of a class member, their spouse, or dependents
• High-Risk Fund o Replicates the last-dollar or “Cadillac” Medicare supplement that the Defendant provided to its retirees o Gives class members the option to recover funds to pay for significant pharmaceutical costs not covered by the Medicare supplement, such as costs of specialty drugs or items that fall within the “donut hole”
o Provides only for expenses that are: a) covered under Medicare Part D, b) incurred for the treatment of a class member, and c) not paid for by class member's Part D Plan (members must have a Part D plan to submit expenses for reimbursement from the High Risk Fund, must submit the bill to the settlement administrator with an explanation of benefits or other proof of rejection of coverage by the class member's Part D Plan)
o Per capita lifetime cap of $10,000 per class member
• Class Administration o Walters Administration has been secured to review bids for providing the HRA and administering the High-Risk Fund. This arrangement entails a one-time fee without any additional “trailing fees” that come out of individual class members accounts o Wesbanco Bank will be the placeholder of all accounts and will administer reimbursements along with the class administrator (Walters Administration)
o Chris Walters of Walters Administration will be a co-signer on all accounts at Wesbanco and will approve all payments o Reimbursements for expenses submitted to the settlement accounts will be released weekly o Class members will have withdrawal power from any of their accounts for approved reimbursements for covered medical expenses
• Class Representative Service Fee o The three Class Representatives will receive service fees of $15,000 each for performing important services for the benefit of the class by commencing litigation
The Parties assert that this settlement represents strong value for the proposed class. There are 211 proposed class members of eligible retirees who were affected by the challenged actions regarding the retiree benefit plan. The settlement's Common Fund equals $4,974,500. The proposed attorney fee in the settlement is 20% of the Common Fund, or $994,900, to be distributed at the time the settlement is fully funded by Defendant, leaving $3,979,600 in the Common Fund. Divided between the 211 proposed class members, this totals $18,860.66 per class member. Without the settlement, the class members receive $250/month in the HRA, or $3,000 a year, subject to Defendant's right to terminate all payments at any time. The settlement amount represents over six years future benefits, in addition to coverage through the High-Risk Fund.
The Court finds that the class representatives and counsel have adequately represented the interests of the class, as noted in the discussion on class certification. The proposed settlement was negotiated and agreed upon at arm's length before Magistrate Judge Eifert, avoiding the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal. Further, the settlement provides detailed and efficient proposed methods of distributing HRA funds to the proposed settlement class as well as fair terms for proposed attorney's fees. This settlement certainly benefits the proposed class members equally. The proposed class currently risk losing benefits under Defendant's right to terminate payments and currently have no High-Risk Fund benefit. This settlement gives the proposed settlement class over six years of benefits and access to the High-Risk Fund. Thus, the Court preliminarily approves of this settlement.
c. Proposed class notice is appropriate
Rule 23(c)(2)(B) requires that the proposed class receive the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B). The Parties here propose two rounds of individualized class notice by U.S. Mail. The first round will notify the class of certification and proposed settlement, enabling objections or opting out, and noticing the fairness hearing. The second round will inform the class as to whether the Court has approved the final settlement agreement and how they can retrieve and utilize their settlement payments. A sixty-day period for notice is proposed as a customary and reasonable amount of time to unsure due consideration and opportunity to opt out. The proposed class notice submitted by the Parties (ECF No. 62-3). The Court FINDS that this notice properly informs the class members of the nature of the action, the definition of the certified class, the claims and issues in this matter, the option to appear at the hearing, the option to be excluded from the class, and the binding effect of the class settlement.
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Certify the Class for Settlement Purposes and to Approve Class Settlement and Notice. ECF No. 62.
A Final Approval Hearing shall be held on October 31, 2022, at 1:30 P.M., before the Court in Huntington, West Virginia to consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and should be given final approval. The date or time of the hearing may be changed without further notice to the Settlement Class.
The notice must be sent to the proposed class on or before 14 days after the entry of this Order.
Any class member who objects to the settlement will have 60 days to notify the Clerk of the Court of their objection.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

Former hospital worker claims wrongful discharge

By Lhalie Castillo
Jun 20, 2016
HUNTINGTON — A former employee is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. and Thomas Jones, a health facility and its director of environmental services, citing alleged retaliatory discharge, sexual harassment and hostile environment, wrongful discharge and outrage.
Brandon Barber filed a complaint on April 29 in Cabell Circuit Court against the defendants, alleging that they terminated his employment due to a non-work-related reason.
According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that, in 2014, he received requests from defendant Jones to find him a girlfriend. The plaintiff alleges he was pressured to do so and was threatened with being discharged if he didn't comply. Furthermore, the plaintiff was told to "flirt" with his co-workers so as to be likable, he alleges. The plaintiff says he reported these matters to a supervisor but his complaint was ignored. On Oct. 15, 2015, the plaintiff was fired on grounds that he was not able to work on weekends., he alleges The plaintiff holds Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. and Jones responsible because of the alleged failure to conduct an investigation about the complaints reported by the plaintiff. Jones was not reprimanded for his actions and behavior and the plaintiff was terminated despite his excellent performance at work, the suit alleges.
The plaintiff requests a trial by jury and seeks actual damages for lost wages, lost compensation and fringe benefits; general and compensatory damages; punitive damages; prejudgment and postjudgment interest; all costs incurred in pursuing this action; attorney fees; and such other relief as the court deems fair and proper in the interest of justice. He is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Law Office of Hoyt Glazer, PLLC in Huntington.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

HUNTINGTON — The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued a confirmatory action letter to Cabell Huntington Hospital documenting a series of corrective actions it has agreed to carry out in response to a potential overexposure to radiation involving a physician.
Cabell Huntington submitted a report to the NRC on Oct. 23 stating that the physician experienced radiological exposure to his extremities in excess of NRC safety limits. The exposures occurred throughout 2021, and involved nuclear medicine treatments using yttrium-90, or Y-90 microspheres, and technetium-99m, or Tc-99m, as well as state-licensed radiation sources, the NRC said in a press release issued Friday.

Federal judge grants class certification, grants preliminary approval in Cabell retiree case
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Aug 16, 2022
HUNTINGTON — Federal Judge Robert C. Chambers has preliminarily approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and retirees who claimed it misrepresented its retiree health and welfare benefits.
The class includes the 211 non-union retirees from Cabell who received notification last year that their retiree benefits would be terminated.
Chambers wrote in his Aug. 10 memorandum opinion and order that while the defendant denies the allegations against it, it nonetheless agreed to the class action settlement and he would grant the motion to certify the class and approve the class settlement and notice.
A final approval hearing will be held on Oct. 31 to consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and if it should be given final approval.
"The parties agreed to settle this matter pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) regarding plaintiffs’ allegations that defendant’s agents made material misrepresentations in substantially the same form to all affected Individuals, indicating that the hospital would provide cost-free retiree health insurance for pre-65 retirees, and Medicare supplemental benefits thereafter throughout the lives of retirees," Chambers wrote.
If approved in October, the settlement would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of the 211 non-union retirees. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would also be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would go toward attorneys' fees, administrative fees and service fees.
The employees alleged in the 2021 law suit that Cabell Huntington Hospital had violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by misrepresenting its lifetime retiree health and welfare benefits.
Martha "Marty" Blenko and Laura Mullarky filed the class-action lawsuit alleging that CHH repeatedly represented to them they could retire as non-union employees beginning at age 62 and retain their health insurance if they had attained 17 years of credited service, according to a complaint filed May 25, 2021, in federal court.
"Cabell further informed the plaintiffs Cabell would provide comparable health insurance to the non-union retirees until they became Medicare-eligible, and that Cabell would then provide a comparable, cost-free Medicare supplement throughout the rest of those retirees’ lives," the complaint states.
Blenko said she and Mullarky and the class members just want what they were promised.
"Cabell's action takes away precious benefits to people who have planned their retirement income on the knowledge that we would not have medical health premiums to pay," Blenko said in a previous interview with The West Virginia Record. "The group of retirees includes many elderly (80+years) with severe medical problems. We don’t deserve to have our benefits pulled out from underneath us at such a medically vulnerable time in our lives. We want the plans and benefits we worked for and were promised. The retirees proudly and loyally gave their service to Cabell Huntington Hospital because of these benefits. We were told during the hiring process, in numerous employee meetings, and again at retirement, that we would receive these benefits for life. The change of the lifetime health benefits policy should not include those currently retired."
However, the plaintiffs claim the hospital breached its fiduciary duties by misleading them regarding their retiree welfare benefits and inducing them to retire based on misrepresentations about their likely receipt of future benefits under the operative welfare benefit plan, according to the suit.
The plaintiffs claim in January 2021, the hospital announced the termination of welfare benefits for non-union retirees effective March 31, 2021, which was later extended to September 2021.
The plaintiffs want an injunction to prevent the termination of retiree welfare benefits because the loss of benefits would cause them to immediately postpone or forego critical medical care during a medically vulnerable time as the population is attempting to emerge from a global pandemic.
"Defendant also failed to timely provide plaintiffs with a copy of the summary plan description (SPD) when the plaintiffs first became participants in the relevant plan," the complaint states. "Specifically, defendant failed to timely provide plaintiffs with a copy of the SPD when it adopted a new retiree welfare benefits plan in 2019, and yet continued misrepresenting the retiree welfare benefits would remain the same as they had been under the prior plan in place from 1955 to 2019."
Blenko and Mullarky retired from Cabell as non-union employees in 2018 and 2019. They met with hospital personnel prior to retirement and discussed their retirement plans.
The plaintiffs are represented by Samuel B. Petsonk of Petsonk PLLC in Beckley and Bren J. Pomponio and Laura Davidson of Mountain State Justice in Charleston.

Two retired hospital workers filed a federal lawsuit accusing West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital of terminating retiree health coverage after repeatedly telling non-union workers they would receive lifetime coverage if they stayed with the company for at least 17 years.
The proposed class action, docketed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, challenges Cabell Huntington’s plans to terminate welfare benefits for non-union retirees in September.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

Former hospital worker claims wrongful discharge

By Lhalie Castillo
Jun 20, 2016
HUNTINGTON — A former employee is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. and Thomas Jones, a health facility and its director of environmental services, citing alleged retaliatory discharge, sexual harassment and hostile environment, wrongful discharge and outrage.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that, in 2014, he received requests from defendant Jones to find him a girlfriend. The plaintiff alleges he was pressured to do so and was threatened with being discharged if he didn't comply. Furthermore, the plaintiff was told to "flirt" with his co-workers so as to be likable, he alleges. The plaintiff says he reported these matters to a supervisor but his complaint was ignored. On Oct. 15, 2015, the plaintiff was fired on grounds that he was not able to work on weekends., he alleges The plaintiff holds Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. and Jones responsible because of the alleged failure to conduct an investigation about the complaints reported by the plaintiff. Jones was not reprimanded for his actions and behavior and the plaintiff was terminated despite his excellent performance at work, the suit alleges.
The plaintiff requests a trial by jury and seeks actual damages for lost wages, lost compensation and fringe benefits; general and compensatory damages; punitive damages; prejudgment and postjudgment interest; all costs incurred in pursuing this action; attorney fees; and such other relief as the court deems fair and proper in the interest of justice.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

HUNTINGTON — The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued a confirmatory action letter to Cabell Huntington Hospital documenting a series of corrective actions it has agreed to carry out in response to a potential overexposure to radiation involving a physician.
Cabell Huntington submitted a report to the NRC on Oct. 23 stating that the physician experienced radiological exposure to his extremities in excess of NRC safety limits. The exposures occurred throughout 2021, and involved nuclear medicine treatments using yttrium-90, or Y-90 microspheres, and technetium-99m, or Tc-99m, as well as state-licensed radiation sources, the NRC said in a press release issued Friday.

Federal judge grants class certification, grants preliminary approval in Cabell retiree case
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Aug 16, 2022
HUNTINGTON — Federal Judge Robert C. Chambers has preliminarily approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and retirees who claimed it misrepresented its retiree health and welfare benefits.
The class includes the 211 non-union retirees from Cabell who received notification last year that their retiree benefits would be terminated.
Chambers wrote in his Aug. 10 memorandum opinion and order that while the defendant denies the allegations against it, it nonetheless agreed to the class action settlement and he would grant the motion to certify the class and approve the class settlement and notice.
A final approval hearing will be held on Oct. 31 to consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and if it should be given final approval.
"The parties agreed to settle this matter pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) regarding plaintiffs’ allegations that defendant’s agents made material misrepresentations in substantially the same form to all affected Individuals, indicating that the hospital would provide cost-free retiree health insurance for pre-65 retirees, and Medicare supplemental benefits thereafter throughout the lives of retirees," Chambers wrote.
If approved in October, the settlement would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of the 211 non-union retirees. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would also be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would go toward attorneys' fees, administrative fees and service fees.
The employees alleged in the 2021 law suit that Cabell Huntington Hospital had violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by misrepresenting its lifetime retiree health and welfare benefits.
Martha "Marty" Blenko and Laura Mullarky filed the class-action lawsuit alleging that CHH repeatedly represented to them they could retire as non-union employees beginning at age 62 and retain their health insurance if they had attained 17 years of credited service, according to a complaint filed May 25, 2021, in federal court.
"Cabell further informed the plaintiffs Cabell would provide comparable health insurance to the non-union retirees until they became Medicare-eligible, and that Cabell would then provide a comparable, cost-free Medicare supplement throughout the rest of those retirees’ lives," the complaint states.
Blenko said she and Mullarky and the class members just want what they were promised.
"Cabell's action takes away precious benefits to people who have planned their retirement income on the knowledge that we would not have medical health premiums to pay," Blenko said in a previous interview with The West Virginia Record. "The group of retirees includes many elderly (80+years) with severe medical problems. We don’t deserve to have our benefits pulled out from underneath us at such a medically vulnerable time in our lives. We want the plans and benefits we worked for and were promised. The retirees proudly and loyally gave their service to Cabell Huntington Hospital because of these benefits. We were told during the hiring process, in numerous employee meetings, and again at retirement, that we would receive these benefits for life. The change of the lifetime health benefits policy should not include those currently retired."
However, the plaintiffs claim the hospital breached its fiduciary duties by misleading them regarding their retiree welfare benefits and inducing them to retire based on misrepresentations about their likely receipt of future benefits under the operative welfare benefit plan, according to the suit.
The plaintiffs claim in January 2021, the hospital announced the termination of welfare benefits for non-union retirees effective March 31, 2021, which was later extended to September 2021.
The plaintiffs want an injunction to prevent the termination of retiree welfare benefits because the loss of benefits would cause them to immediately postpone or forego critical medical care during a medically vulnerable time as the population is attempting to emerge from a global pandemic.
"Defendant also failed to timely provide plaintiffs with a copy of the summary plan description (SPD) when the plaintiffs first became participants in the relevant plan," the complaint states. "Specifically, defendant failed to timely provide plaintiffs with a copy of the SPD when it adopted a new retiree welfare benefits plan in 2019, and yet continued misrepresenting the retiree welfare benefits would remain the same as they had been under the prior plan in place from 1955 to 2019."
Blenko and Mullarky retired from Cabell as non-union employees in 2018 and 2019. They met with hospital personnel prior to retirement and discussed their retirement plans.
The plaintiffs are represented by Samuel B. Petsonk of Petsonk PLLC in Beckley and Bren J. Pomponio and Laura Davidson of Mountain State Justice in Charleston.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

PROTECTIONS AGAINST SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS
Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills
When you get emergency care or get treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from surprise billing or balance billing.
What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?
When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, such as a copayment, coinsurance, and/or a deductible. You may have other costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn’t in your health plan’s network.
“Out-of-network” describes providers and facilities that haven’t signed a contract with your health plan. Out-of-network providers may be permitted to bill you for the difference between what your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged for a service. This is called “balance billing.” This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your annual out-of-pocket limit.
“Surprise billing” is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can’t control who is involved in your care–like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider.
You are protected from balance billing for:
Emergency Services
If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of-network provider or facility, the most the provider or facility may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount (such as copayments and coinsurance). You can’t be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you’re in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization services.
Additionally, West Virginia law protects patients by limiting patients’ payments for out-of-network emergency services to their in-network cost sharing amounts. This law applies to patients with coverage through health maintenance organizations, health care corporations, individual accident and sickness insurers, group accident and sickness insurers, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, dental service corporations, and health service corporations.
Certain services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center
When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers can’t balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed.
If you get other services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can’t balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.
You’re never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren’t required to get care out-of-network. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan’s network.
When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have the following protections:
You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that you would pay if the provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay out-of-network providers and facilities directly.
Your health plan generally must:
Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (prior authorization).
Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers.
Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost-sharing) on what it would pay an in-network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits.
Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward your deductible and out-of-pocket limit.
If you believe you've been wrongly billed, you may  contact:
The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises for more information about your rights under federal law.
Your health plan to ask them why you got the bill and if it’s correct. If it was an emergency, ask your health plan if they processed your claim as an emergency.
The West Virginia Offices of the Insurance Commissioner at https://www.wvinsurance.gov/Consumer_Services or by phone at 1-888-TRY WVIC (888-879-9842) or (304) 558-3386.
Good Faith Estimate
You have the right to receive a "Good Faith Estimate" explaining how much your medical care will cost.
Under the law, healthcare providers need to give patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.
You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment and hospital fees.
Make sure your healthcare provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least one business day before your medical service or item. You can also ask your healthcare provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service.
If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.

FTC Dismisses Complaint Challenging Merger of Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center
July 6, 2016
Tags: Competition Bureau of Competition
The Federal Trade Commission has voted to dismiss without prejudice its administrative complaint challenging the proposed merger between Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center – two hospitals located three miles apart in Huntington, West Virginia.
The FTC’s administrative complaint, issued in November 2015, alleged that the proposed merger violated U.S. antitrust law. The Commission voted to dismiss the complaint in light of the passage in March 2016 of a new West Virginia law relating to certain “cooperative agreements” between hospitals in that state, and the West Virginia Health Care Authority’s decision to approve a cooperative agreement between the hospitals, with which the West Virginia Attorney General concurred. Cooperative agreement laws seek to replace antitrust enforcement with state regulation and supervision of healthcare provider combinations.
“This case presents another example of healthcare providers attempting to use state legislation to shield potentially anticompetitive combinations from antitrust enforcement,” the Commission wrote in a statement. “The Commission believes that state cooperative agreement laws such as SB 597 are likely to harm communities through higher healthcare prices and lower healthcare quality.”
The Commission statement notes that proponents of cooperative agreement laws claim that antitrust enforcement undermines the policy goals of the Affordable Care Act to improve quality and lower costs through greater coordination among healthcare providers. “This is fundamentally incorrect,” the Commission wrote. “The ACA did not repeal the antitrust laws, and it certainly does not condone mergers that substantially lessen competition.”
The Commission further states, “we will continue to vigorously investigate and, where appropriate, challenge anticompetitive mergers in the courts and, if necessary, through state cooperative agreement processes. Our decision to dismiss this complaint without prejudice does not necessarily mean that we will do the same in other cases in which a cooperative agreement is sought or approved.”
The Commission vote to approve the Commission statement and withdraw the administrative complaint was 3-0.  
The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. You can learn more about how competition benefits consumers or file an antitrust complaint.

PROTECTIONS AGAINST SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS
Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills
When you get emergency care or get treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from surprise billing or balance billing.
What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?
When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, such as a copayment, coinsurance, and/or a deductible. You may have other costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn’t in your health plan’s network.
“Out-of-network” describes providers and facilities that haven’t signed a contract with your health plan. Out-of-network providers may be permitted to bill you for the difference between what your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged for a service. This is called “balance billing.” This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your annual out-of-pocket limit.
“Surprise billing” is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can’t control who is involved in your care–like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider.
You are protected from balance billing for:
Emergency Services
If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of-network provider or facility, the most the provider or facility may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount (such as copayments and coinsurance). You can’t be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you’re in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization services.
Additionally, West Virginia law protects patients by limiting patients’ payments for out-of-network emergency services to their in-network cost sharing amounts. This law applies to patients with coverage through health maintenance organizations, health care corporations, individual accident and sickness insurers, group accident and sickness insurers, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, dental service corporations, and health service corporations.
Certain services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center
When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers may bill you is your plan’s in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers can’t balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed.
If you get other services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can’t balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.
You’re never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren’t required to get care out-of-network. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan’s network.
When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have the following protections:
You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that you would pay if the provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay out-of-network providers and facilities directly.
Your health plan generally must:
Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (prior authorization).
Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers.
Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost-sharing) on what it would pay an in-network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits.
Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward your deductible and out-of-pocket limit.
If you believe you've been wrongly billed, you may  contact:
The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises for more information about your rights under federal law.
Your health plan to ask them why you got the bill and if it’s correct. If it was an emergency, ask your health plan if they processed your claim as an emergency.
The West Virginia Offices of the Insurance Commissioner at https://www.wvinsurance.gov/Consumer_Services or by phone at 1-888-TRY WVIC (888-879-9842) or (304) 558-3386.
Good Faith Estimate
You have the right to receive a "Good Faith Estimate" explaining how much your medical care will cost.
Under the law, healthcare providers need to give patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.
You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment and hospital fees.
Make sure your healthcare provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least one business day before your medical service or item. You can also ask your healthcare provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service.
If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.
Get More Information
For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate, visit cms.gov/nosurprises or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).

On July 6, 2016 the FTC voted to abandon its challenge to the merger of Cabell Huntington and St. Mary’s hospitals in light of state legislation that exempted the deal from federal antitrust scrutiny. The West Virginia Healthcare Authority had approved the merger in June, despite the fact that the FTC had tried to block the deal last November. The WV state legislature’s SB 597, which gave the Attorney General and Health Care Authority Jurisdiction over cooperative agreements like the one at issue here and provided for an exemption from federal antitrust scrutiny, went into effect in March 2016.

FTC Dismisses Complaint Challenging Merger of Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center
July 6, 2016
Tags: Competition Bureau of Competition
The Federal Trade Commission has voted to dismiss without prejudice its administrative complaint challenging the proposed merger between Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center – two hospitals located three miles apart in Huntington, West Virginia.
The FTC’s administrative complaint, issued in November 2015, alleged that the proposed merger violated U.S. antitrust law. The Commission voted to dismiss the complaint in light of the passage in March 2016 of a new West Virginia law relating to certain “cooperative agreements” between hospitals in that state, and the West Virginia Health Care Authority’s decision to approve a cooperative agreement between the hospitals, with which the West Virginia Attorney General concurred. Cooperative agreement laws seek to replace antitrust enforcement with state regulation and supervision of healthcare provider combinations.
“This case presents another example of healthcare providers attempting to use state legislation to shield potentially anticompetitive combinations from antitrust enforcement,” the Commission wrote in a statement. “The Commission believes that state cooperative agreement laws such as SB 597 are likely to harm communities through higher healthcare prices and lower healthcare quality.”
The Commission statement notes that proponents of cooperative agreement laws claim that antitrust enforcement undermines the policy goals of the Affordable Care Act to improve quality and lower costs through greater coordination among healthcare providers. “This is fundamentally incorrect,” the Commission wrote. “The ACA did not repeal the antitrust laws, and it certainly does not condone mergers that substantially lessen competition.”
The Commission further states, “we will continue to vigorously investigate and, where appropriate, challenge anticompetitive mergers in the courts and, if necessary, through state cooperative agreement processes. Our decision to dismiss this complaint without prejudice does not necessarily mean that we will do the same in other cases in which a cooperative agreement is sought or approved.”
The Commission vote to approve the Commission statement and withdraw the administrative complaint was 3-0.

Susan: Thank you, Manny, for your thoughtful follow-up questions. Here's my detailed response to each of your queries:

### Financial Information

   - Within the annual reports, focus on sections like the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Look for indicators such as revenue, operating expenses, net income, and patient service revenue.
   - Key financial figures and ratios to consider include operating margin, profit margin, current ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio. These will give us insight into financial health and sustainability.

2. **Financial Rating Agencies:**
   - I have not yet located recent ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, or S&P. Once we gather this data, we should note any trends in their assessments which could indicate financial stability or potential risks.

3. **Industry Publications:**
   - Industry reports from sources like Modern Healthcare, Becker’s Hospital Review, and the American Hospital Association have historically provided valuable insights. Specifically, we should look for hospital comparison reports and market analysis that mention Cabell Huntington Hospital.

### Key Decision Makers
1. **Official Website and LinkedIn:**
   - Prioritize roles such as the CEO, CFO, COO, and Board Members. These positions typically hold the most influence over strategic and operational decisions.
   - I will keep an eye out for notable career trajectories, previous employers, and any affiliations that could serve as points of leverage. Additionally, any history with labor unions or employee relations will be particularly relevant.

2. **Press Releases:**
   - So far, I have not come across any press releases mentioning new or outgoing executives. I will make sure to include any such findings in our final document as they can indicate shifts in the hospital's strategic direction.

2. **News Outlets and Press Releases:**
   - There have been some mentions of labor disputes and negotiations in local news sources. I will compile a summary of these issues, highlighting any ongoing or notable recent events.

### Notable News and Scandals

   - We should look more deeply into potential scandals involving financial misconduct or regulatory violations, as these can significantly impact both the hospital’s reputation and leverage points.
   - So far, there have been mentions of patient care issues, which I'll investigate further to provide context and details.

2. **Social Media and Forums:**
   - I have not yet identified specific profiles or forums with active discussions, but platforms like Reddit's “r/nursing” or local Facebook groups might offer useful insights. These sources can often provide more candid feedback and personal experiences.

### Points of Leverage
1. **Community Relations:**
   - I have found mentions of some community projects, such as health fairs and local partnerships. I will delve deeper to assess their scope and impact.
   - Local advocacy groups or influential community figures that have strong ties with the hospital will be identified, as they can serve as leverage points.

2. **Political Connections:**
   - I have not found significant political contributions yet, but I will continue to check OpenSecrets and FEC filings. Also, any lobbying efforts or political affiliations that may impact our strategy will be thoroughly documented.

### General Clarifications
1. **Document Format:**

2. **Resource Allocation:**

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV -- Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmed
Moody's
Fri, Feb 11, 202213 min read
Rating Action: Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmedGlobal Credit Research - 11 Feb 2022New York, February 11, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service affirmed Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc's (Cabell) (WV) Baa1 revenue bond rating. The outlook is revised to negative from stable. Cabell had approximately $338 million in outstanding debt at fiscal year end 2021.RATINGS RATIONALEAffirmation of the Baa1 rating reflects Cabell's leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's Medical Center. Margins will also be constrained by the system's weak service area and high concentration of government payors that results in a high dependency on supplemental payment programs. Despite cash softening due to revenue cycle disruptions following an IT conversion, debt coverage metrics will remain solid.RATING OUTLOOKThe revision of the outlook to negative reflects the material departure from historical operating performance, as well as budget, and the expected persistence of labor-related expense pressures. An inability to restore operating cash flow to higher levels, and/or a notable decline in liquidity metrics would likely pressure the rating.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Material and durable improvement in operating performance- Strengthening of liquidity and leverage metricsFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Inability to build operating performance to levels more in line with historical levels- Decline in liquidity that results in weakened metrics- Increase in financial leverage without commensurate increase in cash flowLEGAL SECURITYCabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center, Inc. comprise the obligated group on all parity obligations. The bonds are secured by a pledge of gross receipts. Covenants under the amended and restated Master Trust Indenture include a maximum annual debt service coverage test of 1.10 times which would trigger a consultant call-in; coverage that is below 1.0 times for two consecutive years is an event of default.PROFILECabell Huntington Hospital is a regional referral center with over 300 beds and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine. In May 2018, Cabell became the sole member of St. Mary's Medical Center, a tertiary care hospital with 393 beds. Both hospitals are located in Huntington, WV. In addition to the hospitals, the system owns various outpatient sites, and is the largest healthcare system in the primary service area. The combined system saw 40,887 inpatient admissions in FY 2021 and over 30,000 surgeries.Cabell Huntington is also the sole member of Mountain Health Network, Inc. which provides management services and strategic planning for the system.METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Not-For-Profit Healthcare published in December 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1154632.

If I Buy A $100,000 Annuity, How Much Cash Will It Pay Me Each Month?
An annuity is like a personal pension plan you buy for yourself. You give an insurance company a chunk of money – say $100,000 – and in return, they promise to pay you a steady income immediately or start later.

Full text of "Full Filing" for fiscal year ending Sept. 2019
Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV -- Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmed
Moody's
Fri, Feb 11, 202213 min read
Rating Action: Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmedGlobal Credit Research - 11 Feb 2022New York, February 11, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service affirmed Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc's (Cabell) (WV) Baa1 revenue bond rating. The outlook is revised to negative from stable. Cabell had approximately $338 million in outstanding debt at fiscal year end 2021.RATINGS RATIONALEAffirmation of the Baa1 rating reflects Cabell's leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's Medical Center. Margins will also be constrained by the system's weak service area and high concentration of government payors that results in a high dependency on supplemental payment programs. Despite cash softening due to revenue cycle disruptions following an IT conversion, debt coverage metrics will remain solid.RATING OUTLOOKThe revision of the outlook to negative reflects the material departure from historical operating performance, as well as budget, and the expected persistence of labor-related expense pressures. An inability to restore operating cash flow to higher levels, and/or a notable decline in liquidity metrics would likely pressure the rating.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Material and durable improvement in operating performance- Strengthening of liquidity and leverage metricsFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Inability to build operating performance to levels more in line with historical levels- Decline in liquidity that results in weakened metrics- Increase in financial leverage without commensurate increase in cash flowLEGAL SECURITYCabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center, Inc. comprise the obligated group on all parity obligations. The bonds are secured by a pledge of gross receipts. Covenants under the amended and restated Master Trust Indenture include a maximum annual debt service coverage test of 1.10 times which would trigger a consultant call-in; coverage that is below 1.0 times for two consecutive years is an event of default.PROFILECabell Huntington Hospital is a regional referral center with over 300 beds and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine. In May 2018, Cabell became the sole member of St. Mary's Medical Center, a tertiary care hospital with 393 beds. Both hospitals are located in Huntington, WV. In addition to the hospitals, the system owns various outpatient sites, and is the largest healthcare system in the primary service area. The combined system saw 40,887 inpatient admissions in FY 2021 and over 30,000 surgeries.Cabell Huntington is also the sole member of Mountain Health Network, Inc. which provides management services and strategic planning for the system.METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Not-For-Profit Healthcare published in December 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1154632.

Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Earlier today, members of Cabell Huntington Hospital's leadership team joined representatives from Marshall Health, MIRC Construction Services, LLC and Edward Tucker Architects, Inc. for a “Steel Top Out” ceremony, which marked the end of the steel erection portion of construction on the hospital's brand new Medical Office Building (MOB). Celebrating this milestone is a tradition in construction in which a steel beam is signed, raised and put in place. 

The MOB is being constructed on the main campus of Cabell Huntington Hospital, adjacent to the parking garage. The new structure will be five floors totaling approximately 75,000 square feet of space with two access walkways – one from the parking garage and one to Marshall Health and the main hospital. The MOB project as of now is slightly ahead of schedule.

Nearly 100 health care leaders, state dignitaries and community members joined together today at Cabell Huntington Hospital for the unveiling of the newly named Robert and Lena Shell Outpatient Medical Pavilion. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the hospital’s main campus with a special dedication honoring the Shell family, a prominent Huntington family recognized for its significant commitment to Marshall Health Network.

Todd Shell, son of the late Robert "Bob" Shell, said Father’s Day weekend was the perfect time to make this announcement to honor his father's legacy. He added, "We are here today because of the love, dedication, hard work, long hours and absolute devotion to my dad’s health care. We are so grateful to the hospitals, the physicians and the staff of Marshall Health Network.”

It is a sad testament to the state of healthcare in New Yorks State that there are more F rates facilities in New York than anywhere else, and New York does not boast one single A rated facility. I fear the situation will only worsen especially with recent reports that there are more rural hospitals at risk of closure in New York than any other state. NYS leadership needs to step up for the sake and safety of our citizens to provide the healthcare they deserve.

If you are lucky enough to be a part of a rural community that still has a hospital, and if you are particularly lucky enough to have that hospital still deliver babies, take a moment to consider what it would be like if that hospital did not exist, or if it no longer delivered babies.  How much longer would it take for you or your family member to receive care in a crisis?  How much further will an expectant mother need to travel for maternity care and delivery?  Then, take a moment to imagine the economic impact of the closure of that hospital, on the overall community.  If you are not involved in advocating to keep care local, please consider how you might begin to consider it. #ruralhealthcare #ruralcommunities

Logan Regional Medical Center, located in Logan, West Virginia, is crucial to keeping residents in this small community healthy from the moment they are born. At a time when maternal care is disappearing in rural areas, it has three labor suites and a nine-bed nursery. 

LRMC, along with other rural hospitals across the country, is a cornerstone of the community it serves. Faced with unique challenges, however, these hospitals are dwindling in number -- and proposals by some in Congress threaten to lower their numbers even more. 

Learn more about the crucial impact of these hospitals, and proposals to save them, from the Federation of American Hospitals:

By constructing outstanding healthcare facilities for the NHS, our projects are helping to improve outcomes and experiences for thousands of people. 

But don’t just take our word for it. We recently met Michael Simms, who was the first patient to be treated at Basingstoke Hospital’s Hampshire Heart Centre. 

We were astonished to hear that just 12 months after his procedure, 70-year-old avid cyclist Mr Simms is back to peddling 20 miles a day.  

Watch his inspirational story below.

Last night, the largest employer in Louisville, Colorado, implored City Council to approve the Redtail Ridge proposal, enabling Avista Hospital to move into a new, state-of-the-art facility capable of serving 300,000+ more people in a 17-minute drive time. Hospital officials made clear that their future in Louisville is in doubt without Council's approval.

Earlier today, members of Cabell Huntington Hospital's leadership team joined representatives from Marshall Health, MIRC Construction Services, LLC and Edward Tucker Architects, Inc. for a “Steel Top Out” ceremony, which marked the end of the steel erection portion of construction on the hospital's brand new Medical Office Building (MOB). Celebrating this milestone is a tradition in construction in which a steel beam is signed, raised and put in place. 

The MOB is being constructed on the main campus of Cabell Huntington Hospital, adjacent to the parking garage. The new structure will be five floors totaling approximately 75,000 square feet of space with two access walkways – one from the parking garage and one to Marshall Health and the main hospital. The MOB project as of now is slightly ahead of schedule.

Nearly 100 health care leaders, state dignitaries and community members joined together today at Cabell Huntington Hospital for the unveiling of the newly named Robert and Lena Shell Outpatient Medical Pavilion. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the hospital’s main campus with a special dedication honoring the Shell family, a prominent Huntington family recognized for its significant commitment to Marshall Health Network.

Todd Shell, son of the late Robert "Bob" Shell, said Father’s Day weekend was the perfect time to make this announcement to honor his father's legacy. He added, "We are here today because of the love, dedication, hard work, long hours and absolute devotion to my dad’s health care. We are so grateful to the hospitals, the physicians and the staff of Marshall Health Network.”

It is a sad testament to the state of healthcare in New Yorks State that there are more F rates facilities in New York than anywhere else, and New York does not boast one single A rated facility. I fear the situation will only worsen especially with recent reports that there are more rural hospitals at risk of closure in New York than any other state. NYS leadership needs to step up for the sake and safety of our citizens to provide the healthcare they deserve.

If you are lucky enough to be a part of a rural community that still has a hospital, and if you are particularly lucky enough to have that hospital still deliver babies, take a moment to consider what it would be like if that hospital did not exist, or if it no longer delivered babies.  How much longer would it take for you or your family member to receive care in a crisis?  How much further will an expectant mother need to travel for maternity care and delivery?  Then, take a moment to imagine the economic impact of the closure of that hospital, on the overall community.  If you are not involved in advocating to keep care local, please consider how you might begin to consider it. #ruralhealthcare #ruralcommunities

Logan Regional Medical Center, located in Logan, West Virginia, is crucial to keeping residents in this small community healthy from the moment they are born. At a time when maternal care is disappearing in rural areas, it has three labor suites and a nine-bed nursery. 

LRMC, along with other rural hospitals across the country, is a cornerstone of the community it serves. Faced with unique challenges, however, these hospitals are dwindling in number -- and proposals by some in Congress threaten to lower their numbers even more.

By constructing outstanding healthcare facilities for the NHS, our projects are helping to improve outcomes and experiences for thousands of people. 

But don’t just take our word for it. We recently met Michael Simms, who was the first patient to be treated at Basingstoke Hospital’s Hampshire Heart Centre. 

We were astonished to hear that just 12 months after his procedure, 70-year-old avid cyclist Mr Simms is back to peddling 20 miles a day.

SEIU, Workers United and UNITE HERE Settle Dispute
Washington, DC - The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Workers United and UNITE HERE today announced a settlement agreement on behalf of the unions' members and elected leadership that will bring to a close the protracted dispute between the unions.

Newly-elected SEIU President Mary Kay Henry, who had made settling this dispute a top priority of her administration, issued the following statement:
Working families all around this nation are facing the most profound crisis since the Great Depression. There are 26 million people out of work and far too many more who are facing cutbacks, layoffs, and benefit reduction. When hardworking people are losing the roof over their head or borrowing money to pay for groceries, we know we have more work to do. This moment calls on all of us in the American labor movement to dedicate ourselves to being part of the solution.

"Despite the tensions that have existed between our unions over the past months, John Wilhelm, Bruce Raynor and I have worked together to find common ground and we've been able to put our differences behind us. We agree that we cannot be spending our time fighting one other over workers who are already represented when there are far too many people who want and need a voice on the job. Our resources and our attention must be put toward solutions for the crisis workers face right now.

"We need to drive change for people in this country. None of us can go it alone. Moving forward, SEIU plans to link arms with our allies in labor and the progressive movement and forge stronger relationships with communities to be a more aggressive force pushing for the demands that help working people on the job, at the bargaining table, and with public policy makers all around our country."
BACKGROUND ON THE AGREEMENT

The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, resolves all issues related to jurisdiction and asset distribution and establishes a process for determining the rightful bargaining representative for the remaining disputed units.

The agreement provides clarity and resolution to a divisive issue in labor, and at the same time, enables each union the opportunity to increase its focus and resources on addressing the larger problems faced by members and workers who have no union.

# # #

With 2.2 million members in Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico, SEIU is the fastest-growing union in the Americas. Focused on uniting workers in healthcare, public services and property services, SEIU members are winning better wages, healthcare and more secure jobs for our communities, while uniting their strength with their counterparts around the world to help ensure that workers--not just corporations and CEOs--benefit from today's global economy."

UHS v. United States ex rel. Escobar: Mental Health Advocates, SEIU Urge U.S. Supreme Court to Protect Mental Health Patients and Whistleblowers
Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Mental Health America, SEIU File Joint Amici Brief
Washington, DC —The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), joined by nationally recognized mental health advocates, Mental Health America and the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, filed an amici curiae brief today in the Supreme Court of the United States in support of a patient’s family in Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar. The family seeks to hold Universal Health Services (UHS) accountable under the False Claims Act (FCA) for claiming Medicaid payments even though UHS’s care failed to meet minimum licensure and supervision requirements for mental health services.  The family’s teenage daughter tragically passed away while under the care of unlicensed and unsupervised staff at a UHS facility in Massachusetts.
The brief clearly shows UHS’s record of violating patient-care requirements throughout the country and demonstrates how vibrant whistleblower tools and claims like the one brought by the family play an important role in protecting patients.  
 "If we commit to taking action before mental illnesses reach Stage 4, then the moment that brings a family into contact with a health care provider is a critical moment for intervention,” said Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO of Mental Health America.  Gionfriddo continued, “And if we don't provide families and individuals with quality care at that time, then we've failed them. And that is something we can't afford to do, if we’re serious about treating mental illnesses the same as we treat other serious health conditions." 
Yarushka Rivera was a 17-year-old girl living with a psychiatric disability who sought care at a UHS facility. The teen was treated by unlicensed and inadequately supervised staff. UHS’s staff prescribed a medication for Ms. Rivera that allegedly led her to develop seizures and she died a few months later of a seizure. UHS then billed the Massachusetts Medicaid program for the girl’s care. Upon investigation of these events, the state’s Department of Public Health and Division of Licensure confirmed  that care was provided by unsupervised staff in violation of state law. 
Ms. Rivera’s family filed a False Claims Act case in federal court in July 2011 and filed a second amended complaint in February 2013. The federal District Court dismissed the case in its entirety in March of 2014—ruling that the regulations allegedly violated by UHS were not “conditions of payment,” which the court deemed to be a pre-requisite to FCA liability.
The family then appealed the dismissal to the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals and in March 2015 that court reversed the dismissal—ruling that compliance with staff supervision and core staffing requirements are a condition of payment by the Massachusetts Medicaid program, MassHealth.
The False Claims Act is one of the country’s most effective tools in combating fraud. In 2015 alone, the Department of Justice recovered more than $3.5 billion in settlements and judgments from FCA cases.
In addition, most false claims actions are filed under the FCA’s whistleblower provisions, which allow individuals to file on behalf on the government. The government has the right to intervene in these actions; if the government declines to intervene, the individual may proceed alone.
UHS seeks to limit potential liability under the FCA, which could have a chilling effect for future whistleblowers and for the quality of health care delivered in any setting. UHS is making hundreds of millions of dollars in profits while its facilities routinely violate state and federal rules designed to protect mental health patients. 
“It is appalling that a company with such a disturbing track record of care would be pushing for the Supreme Court to rewrite the law to silence patients, families, and care providers in the reporting of any potential fraud in our healthcare system,” said Leslie Frane, Division Director, SEIU Healthcare.
The date for oral arguments in this case has not been set yet by the Court.

SEIU's history as a healthcare union began when SEIU Local 250 (now SEIU UHW) started organizing San Francisco nurses in the 1930s. Today, SEIU is the largest healthcare union in the country with 1.2 million nurses, doctors, and healthcare workers.

Every victory for front line healthcare workers has also been a victory for the men, women, and children they care for.
In 1998, the 130,000 members of the New York City-based Local 1199 voted to affiliate with SEIU to become the largest and strongest healthcare union in North America. Building on 1199's own progressive history, SEIU's healthcare division became an even more powerful voice for healthcare workers and patients
Beverly Enterprises
In 1996, nursing home workers at Beverly Enterprises--the nation's largest for-profit nursing home chain--went on a three day strike in Pennsylvania after futile attempts to bargain a new contract. Beverly's response? "Permanently replacing" 500 striking workers. SEIU members in Pennsylvania stood together, protesting and filing lawsuits to reinstate their coworkers. One year later, they won: a federal court ordered Beverly to reinstate the 500 workers and Beverly agreed to a new four year contract. By 2004, confrontation turned into cooperation as Pennsylvania SEIU members and Beverly launched a groundbreaking partnership that gave hundreds of workers the freedom to choose a union without intimidation. Together, they also formed "Pennsylvanians for Quality Care," which improves the care clients receive by providing training and education for more than 200 certified nursing assistants.
Los Angeles Home Care Workers
Home care workers deliver the essential care and helping hands that mean seniors and people with disabilities can chose to live independently at home, rather than in a nursing home. These men and women are the steady source of care for an Alzheimer's patient, or the person who helps a consumer with a disability get out the door to work. Homecare workers assist with daily needs such as bathing, eating, and dressing. In many states, however, these hardworking women and men earn poverty wages, have no sick time, do not have health insurance, and have no access to professional training. That was the situation in Los Angeles in the 1980s when home care workers realized they needed to take a stand.
Thousands of home care workers in California came together to win state legislation ensuring the right to have a voice on the job and to negotiate with their employers over wages and working conditions. In 1992, the California legislature passed this historic legislation that would allow home care workers to have a say in improving the quality of their work and their lives. But Los Angeles County refused to give permission because the disability community feared the legislation would lead to worse care for clients. By reaching out to members of the disability community and building coalitions, Los Angeles homecare workers addressed their concerns and became a united force for change. Los Angeles home care workers won the right to organize in 1997. In the biggest labor election in over fifty years, more than 70,000 home care workers in Los Angeles County voted to join SEIU in 1999.
Catholic Healthcare West
In the 1990's, healthcare workers at Catholic Healthcare West--then the third biggest Catholic hospital network in the nation-- were struggling in the face of short-staffing, cuts in services, and a lack of commitment to the quality of patient care. CHW workers had enough: they had gone into healthcare because of a higher calling and to put the needs of patients first. Healthcare workers began reaching out to key leaders in the Catholic Church to ask for their support and ensure the dignity and respect of all workers. Eventually, even the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Cardinal of Los Angeles stood with workers. This outreach led to a landmark election where more than 10,000 healthcare workers chose to unite with SEIU, free from intimidation or harassment.
HCA
In 2010, hospital workers reached a historic accord with Hospital Corporation of America, the largest for-profit hospital system in the world, ensuring that hospital workers could hold free and fair elections. In less than a year, more than 6,000 healthcare workers at 13 HCA-affiliated hospitals in Texas, Florida, and Kansas City voted to unite with SEIU.

SEIU’s Henry: ACA ruling a victory for essential workers’ demands: respect us, protect us, pay us
San Francisco, Calif. - Service Employees International Union (SEIU) International President Mary Kay Henry released the following statement today after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. SEIU filed an amicus brief illustrating the devastating and lasting consequences working people would face if the ACA were struck down.
“Essential workers have been demanding to be respected, protected and paid, and that includes having access to quality, affordable healthcare. Black and brown workers have been at the forefront leading this fight, as they have with so many other campaigns to build a stronger nation. Working people, including healthcare workers who have been on the front lines of the pandemic, fought to pass the Affordable Care Act and they have defended it ever since. Today is their victory.
“Workers like Kristen Edwards, an adjunct professor of history from California, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and eventually made a full recovery. But when she lost her job in 2011 and began searching for an individual plan to replace her employer-sponsored health insurance, she was horrified to discover that private insurance companies would not cover her because of her past diagnosis. Purchasing an ACA plan allowed Kristen to get health insurance without worrying that her insurer would reject her application because of her medical history. 
“Now it is time to finally turn the page once and for all. Instead of trying to take healthcare away from tens of millions of people, Republican members of Congress need to join efforts that will make healthcare more affordable and accessible. That means working across the aisle to address the overlapping health, economic and racial crises working people are facing with Black, brown and indigenous communities.”

Body Content: Respect Us, Protect Us, and Pay Us, HCA: Fair Contract Now!
HCA Healthcare,
While healthcare workers have been on the frontlines through dangerous conditions caring for patients with COVID-19, HCA racked up $3.75 billion in profits last year and the personal wealth of HCA's founding family and largest shareholders more than doubled to $15.6 billion.

HCA hospital workers have delivered lifesaving patient care throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Despite this, many have been rewarded with poverty wages as low as $12.50/hour and had to fight for adequate PPE access at work. CEO Sam Hazen is paid 1,038 times the pay of many of the essential HCA frontline caregivers who have risked their lives to serve in a global pandemic. Right now, tens of thousands of HCA hospital workers are being paid less than $15 an hour.

HCA is the largest for-profit hospital corporation in America, and should be leading the industry on paying living wages for the healthcare heroes who have selflessly worked through exhaustion, understaffing, and inadequate PPE for more than a year. Instead, HCA workers across the country have been left fighting for a fair contract that will respect us, protect us, and pay us with the basic dignity every worker deserves.

HCA – nurses and caregivers can't afford to wait; I demand you agree to a fair contract now for frontline hospital workers.

SEIU Local 200United members file lawsuit to stop new measures that would gut protections for federal employees
SEIU LOCAL 200UNITED MEMBERS FILE LAWSUIT TO STOP NEW MEASURES THAT WOULD GUT PROTECTIONS FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
08/29/2019
Veterans Affairs hospital workers need strong unions to protect the patients in their care
Share
Post
SEIU Local 200United members who work for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs took legal action Tuesday, challenging three recent executive orders that seek to dramatically rewrite labor laws enacted by Congress to protect federal employees.
These executive orders would prevent federal employees from being able to spend any time helping their unions collectively bargain, take direct aim at the longstanding system of progressive discipline, and impose unlawful constraints on federal agency's ability to bargain. They would affect approximately 2 million federal workers across the country. 
“Those who served our country honorably come to the VA to get the care they deserve,” said Donald Woodworth, an SEIU member who has worked as a Police Officer at the Canandaigua, New York VA for 19 years. “As federal workers, we need to be united in strong unions to help protect working conditions of employees as we serve those veterans who have served us.”
The lawsuit filed on behalf of Local200United members seeks relief for working people like Donald across the country who are subject to these recent measures, and asks the court to stop these orders from going into effect.
“I love the VA and helping my fellow veterans.  I am an employee and a Ft. McClellan veteran with medical needs, I get my care at the VA too.  I give other veterans the same service I want when I go in,” said Advanced Medical Support Assistant Denise Wilson.
“This hits home with me.  We need to protect the rights of employees who help veterans who have sacrificed everything under the sun to protect the civil liberties and freedoms we enjoy every day.  If these executive orders go into effect, it’s going to have a negative impact on lots of people like me.”

Title: HCA Strike FAQ
Link: https://act.seiu.org/a/hca-strike-faq
Snippet: Our <b>hospital</b> has been given a legally-required, 10-day advance notice that we will go on strike for 10 days. If you are in the middle of patient care at 7am and there is imminent danger to a patient, you can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient before walking out at 7am on 12/24.
Body Content: Got Questions? Here are some answers
UPDATED WITH *NEW* HCA STRIKE Q&A's!
  If we work at 6am or before, do we still walk out at 7am?
Yes. Our hospital has been given a legally-required, 10-day advance notice that we will go on strike for 10 days. If you are in the middle of patient care at 7am and there is imminent danger to a patient, you can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient before walking out at 7am on 12/24. Otherwise, management must have strike staff ready to take over at 7am on the dot. That’s what the 10-day notice is for, and your employer has already published information stating they have everything ready to go to ensure continuity of care for patients, which is their legal obligation. 
  Must we call off if we are scheduled to work on the day of the strike?
No, the 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members (i.e., SEIU 121RN members) for the full 5 days of the strike, starting at 7am on Wednesday, November 22. You are not required to call in at all from 11/22 – 11/26, nor to take calls from management during the strike. Your return-to work-date/time is 7am on 1/2/2024. 
  Can I strike if I am a Per Diem?
Yes. Per Diem employees in the bargaining unit are protected by law and covered by the strike notice issued by the Union and may go on strike.
  Can I strike if I am on a leave of absence?
Yes. You are still a bargaining unit member while on leave of absence and therefore you may strike.
  I know that we’re picketing from 7am-12pm at my hospital. Should I go to work after 12pm?
No! The strike (not working at the hospital) covers the full 5-day period beginning at 7am on 12/24 and ending at 7am on 1/2. This is different from strike shifts, which apply to public actions at the hospital. No one should report to work at all from 7am on 12/24 through 1/2.  You are not required to report until 7am on January 2.
  What date, shift, and exact time should we go back to work?
All members should be ready to report at 7am on the dot on January 2. We will share additional information about returning to work before the end of the strike.
  Can we be disciplined for attendance for going out on strike?
No! By law, your employer must respect your right to strike. It is illegal for Management to terminate or retaliate against you for your participation in the strike. Furthermore, if any Manager or Director harasses you about striking, or if you feel like you are being retaliated against in any way (for voting, wearing a sticker, wearing purple), contact your Union Rep right away and we can file charges against Management with the National Labor Relations Board (a federal agency).
  Management says that I cannot talk about the strike at work. Is that true?
The hospitals cannot discriminate against employees for discussing Union matters, including the strike, when they are allowed to discuss any other non-work related matters (such as parties, events, sports, etc.) Such prohibition would be discriminatory and therefore unlawful. 
  Can friends and family attend the strike?
Of course! All supporters are encouraged to join us on the strike line.
  Will my patients be safe and taken care of if I strike?
The law requires that we give the hospital 10 days’ notice before we strike. This will give the hospital ample time to hire temporary staff. Management has already informed everyone, in writing, that  patients will be cared for by fully licensed staff.
  Can management ask me if I will be striking? 
The hospital cannot discriminate against you for discussing Union matters—including the strike—if they allow discussion of other non-work matters (like staff parties, events, sports, etc.) Doing so would be discriminatory, and therefore unlawful.  They can ask if you’re striking, but you are not required to answer.  Refusing to answer cannot be used against you as it would violate your rights to engage in protected, concerted activity.  You can also choose to tell them. It’s entirely up to you.
  I don’t want to get in trouble for patient abandonment in a critical situation. For example: if I’m at a Rapid Response or in a Code Blue (actively dying) do I hand off the patient at 7am or wait to stabilize them?
While Local 121RN has already provided the employer with the legally required 10-day advance notice for our hospital to take reasonable precautions to ensure patient safety, if a member believes that a patient is in imminent danger, they can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient and then hand off the patient to the strike workers that your hospital has already stated they’ve hired in preparation for the strike.
  Can new grads on off-site didactic training strike?
The 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members including those in-training, and none should be disciplined or retaliated against for participating in the strike. If you are represented by 121RN, the notice covers you as well.
  If management threatens me with discipline up to termination if I don’t remove union related insignia (stickers, pins, badge buddies, etc.) what do I do?
Any discipline for wearing union insignia is discriminatory and a violation of the National Labor Rights Act, and your union has notified HCA about its obligation to the law. Meanwhile, if a manager demands that you remove your wearable union items and threatens you if you refuse to remove it, you should explain it’s your right, document the conversation, and then inform a steward or your Union Rep/Organizer so that they can refer it to our legal counsel for prompt follow-up and action.
  Management has implied that SEIU 121RN will fine me if I choose to work and don’t participate in the strike. Is that true?
No. Although your support of each other and participation in the strike shows strength and unity, SEIU Local 121RN is not going to issue fines against members who choose to work.
    Why are we going on strike?
Our Bargaining Team has worked hard to negotiate our new Union contract with hospital management, through a series of meetings that began earlier this year. We’ve proposed language to address critical issues that Nurses and Licensed Medical Professionals face at HCA hospitals—turnover at crisis levels, rampant unsafe staffing, workplace violence, and more. At the bargaining table and on the picket line we’ve stressed the gravity of these problems—but management has just deflected. We are left with no other option but to strike—as an act of protest against these unfair labor practices. It is our legal right to do so.
  But is a strike really necessary?
Your bargaining team would like to settle the contract as soon as possible, and we hope that management will return to the table with acceptable proposals in response to the important issues we’ve raised. Your bargaining team has determined that a strike is the necessary next-step.
  Do I have to Strike?
The expectation is that you will honor the picket line. To truly show unity, you should not come to work, and you should sign up to join the picket line as often as you can.
  Can the Hospital discipline or terminate me if I strike and join the picket line?
By law, your employer must respect your right to strike. It is illegal for Management to terminate or retaliate against you for your participation in the strike. If any Manager or Director harasses you about striking, or if you feel like you are being retaliated against in any way (for voting, wearing a sticker, wearing purple), contact your Union Rep right away and we can file charges against Management with the National Labor Relations Board.
  Are 90-day probationary RNs expected to strike?
The 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members including those in training, and none should be disciplined or retaliated against for participating in the strike. IF you are represented by SEIU 121RN, the notice covers you as well. 
  Will my patients be safe and taken care of if I strike?
The law requires that we give the hospital 10 days’ notice before we strike. This will give the hospital ample time to hire temporary staff. Our patients will be cared for by fully licensed staff.
  Will I be covered by my health insurance during the strike?
Health insurance premiums are paid at the beginning of the month and remain in effect all month.
  Can we be locked out?
The hospital can have a “lock-out”, an exclusion of employees from the workplace during a labor dispute. However, they can’t lock us out in retaliation for going on strike. That would be illegal. And they can’t replace us for striking in protest of their unfair labor practices.
  Can my vacation be canceled if there is a strike?
No, your vacation cannot be canceled. If management cancels your vacation, it can be considered an act of retaliation and discrimination and could be chargeable under the National Labor Relations Act (federal law).  If this happens, inform a Steward or your Union Rep/Organizer right away. 
  Can I use PTO while on strike?
Unless your PTO request has been pre-approved, management may deny your PTO request for the days we strike. Also, note that under the CBA you can cash out PTO at any time (may take 1 pay cycle to pay out. Minimum of 8 hours cashed out. May cash out down to 40 hours in the bank.)
  Do I need to call the hospital on days we’re on strike?
No. As a healthcare facility, our Union is required by law to give 10 days’ notice of when we will go on strike to the hospital and to tell the hospital when we will return.  We, as a Union, will take care of this notice on behalf of our members.
  Will night shift workers be walking the picket line at night?
Due to safety concerns, night shift workers will not picket at night. Night shift workers will, however, be expected to be on the picket line during daytime hours. We will be signing people up for picketing times.
  What is the National Relations Labor Board (NLRB)?
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is comprised of a team of professionals who work to assure fair labor practices and workplace democracy nationwide. Since its creation by Congress in 1935, this small, highly respected, independent Federal agency has had daily impact on the way America's companies, industries and unions conduct business. Agency staff members investigate and remedy unfair labor practices by unions and employers. For more information, please visit nlrb.gov.

SEIU, Workers United and UNITE HERE Settle Dispute
Washington, DC - The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Workers United and UNITE HERE today announced a settlement agreement on behalf of the unions' members and elected leadership that will bring to a close the protracted dispute between the unions.

Newly-elected SEIU President Mary Kay Henry, who had made settling this dispute a top priority of her administration, issued the following statement:
Working families all around this nation are facing the most profound crisis since the Great Depression. There are 26 million people out of work and far too many more who are facing cutbacks, layoffs, and benefit reduction. When hardworking people are losing the roof over their head or borrowing money to pay for groceries, we know we have more work to do. This moment calls on all of us in the American labor movement to dedicate ourselves to being part of the solution.

"Despite the tensions that have existed between our unions over the past months, John Wilhelm, Bruce Raynor and I have worked together to find common ground and we've been able to put our differences behind us. We agree that we cannot be spending our time fighting one other over workers who are already represented when there are far too many people who want and need a voice on the job. Our resources and our attention must be put toward solutions for the crisis workers face right now.

"We need to drive change for people in this country. None of us can go it alone. Moving forward, SEIU plans to link arms with our allies in labor and the progressive movement and forge stronger relationships with communities to be a more aggressive force pushing for the demands that help working people on the job, at the bargaining table, and with public policy makers all around our country."
BACKGROUND ON THE AGREEMENT

The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, resolves all issues related to jurisdiction and asset distribution and establishes a process for determining the rightful bargaining representative for the remaining disputed units.

The agreement provides clarity and resolution to a divisive issue in labor, and at the same time, enables each union the opportunity to increase its focus and resources on addressing the larger problems faced by members and workers who have no union.

# # #

With 2.2 million members in Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico, SEIU is the fastest-growing union in the Americas. Focused on uniting workers in healthcare, public services and property services, SEIU members are winning better wages, healthcare and more secure jobs for our communities, while uniting their strength with their counterparts around the world to help ensure that workers--not just corporations and CEOs--benefit from today's global economy."

UHS v. United States ex rel. Escobar: Mental Health Advocates, SEIU Urge U.S. Supreme Court to Protect Mental Health Patients and Whistleblowers
Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Mental Health America, SEIU File Joint Amici Brief
Washington, DC —The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), joined by nationally recognized mental health advocates, Mental Health America and the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, filed an amici curiae brief today in the Supreme Court of the United States in support of a patient’s family in Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar. The family seeks to hold Universal Health Services (UHS) accountable under the False Claims Act (FCA) for claiming Medicaid payments even though UHS’s care failed to meet minimum licensure and supervision requirements for mental health services.  The family’s teenage daughter tragically passed away while under the care of unlicensed and unsupervised staff at a UHS facility in Massachusetts.
The brief clearly shows UHS’s record of violating patient-care requirements throughout the country and demonstrates how vibrant whistleblower tools and claims like the one brought by the family play an important role in protecting patients.  
 "If we commit to taking action before mental illnesses reach Stage 4, then the moment that brings a family into contact with a health care provider is a critical moment for intervention,” said Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO of Mental Health America.  Gionfriddo continued, “And if we don't provide families and individuals with quality care at that time, then we've failed them. And that is something we can't afford to do, if we’re serious about treating mental illnesses the same as we treat other serious health conditions." 
Yarushka Rivera was a 17-year-old girl living with a psychiatric disability who sought care at a UHS facility. The teen was treated by unlicensed and inadequately supervised staff. UHS’s staff prescribed a medication for Ms. Rivera that allegedly led her to develop seizures and she died a few months later of a seizure. UHS then billed the Massachusetts Medicaid program for the girl’s care. Upon investigation of these events, the state’s Department of Public Health and Division of Licensure confirmed  that care was provided by unsupervised staff in violation of state law. 
Ms. Rivera’s family filed a False Claims Act case in federal court in July 2011 and filed a second amended complaint in February 2013. The federal District Court dismissed the case in its entirety in March of 2014—ruling that the regulations allegedly violated by UHS were not “conditions of payment,” which the court deemed to be a pre-requisite to FCA liability.
The family then appealed the dismissal to the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals and in March 2015 that court reversed the dismissal—ruling that compliance with staff supervision and core staffing requirements are a condition of payment by the Massachusetts Medicaid program, MassHealth.
The False Claims Act is one of the country’s most effective tools in combating fraud. In 2015 alone, the Department of Justice recovered more than $3.5 billion in settlements and judgments from FCA cases.
In addition, most false claims actions are filed under the FCA’s whistleblower provisions, which allow individuals to file on behalf on the government. The government has the right to intervene in these actions; if the government declines to intervene, the individual may proceed alone.
UHS seeks to limit potential liability under the FCA, which could have a chilling effect for future whistleblowers and for the quality of health care delivered in any setting. UHS is making hundreds of millions of dollars in profits while its facilities routinely violate state and federal rules designed to protect mental health patients. 
“It is appalling that a company with such a disturbing track record of care would be pushing for the Supreme Court to rewrite the law to silence patients, families, and care providers in the reporting of any potential fraud in our healthcare system,” said Leslie Frane, Division Director, SEIU Healthcare.
The date for oral arguments in this case has not been set yet by the Court.

Winning a voice for healthcare workers
WINNING A VOICE FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS

The largest labor victory since the UAW organized in Flint, MI.

SEIU's history as a healthcare union began when SEIU Local 250 (now SEIU UHW) started organizing San Francisco nurses in the 1930s. Today, SEIU is the largest healthcare union in the country with 1.2 million nurses, doctors, and healthcare workers. For the past seventy years, SEIU Healthcare members have had one top priority: quality patient care. SEIU members work hard to wiSEIU's history as a healthcare union began when SEIU Local 250 (now SEIU UHW) started organizing San Francisco nurses in the 1930s.n fair wages, benefits, and a voice at the table to speak up for their patients, clients, and consumers. Every victory for front line healthcare workers has also been a victory for the men, women, and children they care for.
In 1998, the 130,000 members of the New York City-based Local 1199 voted to affiliate with SEIU to become the largest and strongest healthcare union in North America. Building on 1199's own progressive history, SEIU's healthcare division became an even more powerful voice for healthcare workers and patients
Beverly Enterprises
In 1996, nursing home workers at Beverly Enterprises--the nation's largest for-profit nursing home chain--went on a three day strike in Pennsylvania after futile attempts to bargain a new contract. Beverly's response? "Permanently replacing" 500 striking workers. SEIU members in Pennsylvania stood together, protesting and filing lawsuits to reinstate their coworkers. One year later, they won: a federal court ordered Beverly to reinstate the 500 workers and Beverly agreed to a new four year contract. By 2004, confrontation turned into cooperation as Pennsylvania SEIU members and Beverly launched a groundbreaking partnership that gave hundreds of workers the freedom to choose a union without intimidation. Together, they also formed "Pennsylvanians for Quality Care," which improves the care clients receive by providing training and education for more than 200 certified nursing assistants.
Los Angeles Home Care Workers
Home care workers deliver the essential care and helping hands that mean seniors and people with disabilities can chose to live independently at home, rather than in a nursing home. These men and women are the steady source of care for an Alzheimer's patient, or the person who helps a consumer with a disability get out the door to work. Homecare workers assist with daily needs such as bathing, eating, and dressing. In many states, however, these hardworking women and men earn poverty wages, have no sick time, do not have health insurance, and have no access to professional training. That was the situation in Los Angeles in the 1980s when home care workers realized they needed to take a stand.
Thousands of home care workers in California came together to win state legislation ensuring the right to have a voice on the job and to negotiate with their employers over wages and working conditions. In 1992, the California legislature passed this historic legislation that would allow home care workers to have a say in improving the quality of their work and their lives. But Los Angeles County refused to give permission because the disability community feared the legislation would lead to worse care for clients. By reaching out to members of the disability community and building coalitions, Los Angeles homecare workers addressed their concerns and became a united force for change. Los Angeles home care workers won the right to organize in 1997. In the biggest labor election in over fifty years, more than 70,000 home care workers in Los Angeles County voted to join SEIU in 1999.
Catholic Healthcare West
In the 1990's, healthcare workers at Catholic Healthcare West--then the third biggest Catholic hospital network in the nation-- were struggling in the face of short-staffing, cuts in services, and a lack of commitment to the quality of patient care. CHW workers had enough: they had gone into healthcare because of a higher calling and to put the needs of patients first. Healthcare workers began reaching out to key leaders in the Catholic Church to ask for their support and ensure the dignity and respect of all workers. Eventually, even the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Cardinal of Los Angeles stood with workers. This outreach led to a landmark election where more than 10,000 healthcare workers chose to unite with SEIU, free from intimidation or harassment.
HCA
In 2010, hospital workers reached a historic accord with Hospital Corporation of America, the largest for-profit hospital system in the world, ensuring that hospital workers could hold free and fair elections. In less than a year, more than 6,000 healthcare workers at 13 HCA-affiliated hospitals in Texas, Florida, and Kansas City voted to unite with SEIU. Today, more than 22,000 healthcare workers at HCA in California, Florida, Kansas, Nevada, and Texas are now united in SEIU.

SEIU’s Henry: ACA ruling a victory for essential workers’ demands: respect us, protect us, pay us
San Francisco, Calif. - Service Employees International Union (SEIU) International President Mary Kay Henry released the following statement today after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. SEIU filed an amicus brief illustrating the devastating and lasting consequences working people would face if the ACA were struck down.
“Essential workers have been demanding to be respected, protected and paid, and that includes having access to quality, affordable healthcare. Black and brown workers have been at the forefront leading this fight, as they have with so many other campaigns to build a stronger nation. Working people, including healthcare workers who have been on the front lines of the pandemic, fought to pass the Affordable Care Act and they have defended it ever since. Today is their victory.
“Workers like Kristen Edwards, an adjunct professor of history from California, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and eventually made a full recovery. But when she lost her job in 2011 and began searching for an individual plan to replace her employer-sponsored health insurance, she was horrified to discover that private insurance companies would not cover her because of her past diagnosis. Purchasing an ACA plan allowed Kristen to get health insurance without worrying that her insurer would reject her application because of her medical history. 
“Now it is time to finally turn the page once and for all. Instead of trying to take healthcare away from tens of millions of people, Republican members of Congress need to join efforts that will make healthcare more affordable and accessible. That means working across the aisle to address the overlapping health, economic and racial crises working people are facing with Black, brown and indigenous communities.”

Body Content: Respect Us, Protect Us, and Pay Us, HCA: Fair Contract Now!
HCA Healthcare,
While healthcare workers have been on the frontlines through dangerous conditions caring for patients with COVID-19, HCA racked up $3.75 billion in profits last year and the personal wealth of HCA's founding family and largest shareholders more than doubled to $15.6 billion.

HCA hospital workers have delivered lifesaving patient care throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Despite this, many have been rewarded with poverty wages as low as $12.50/hour and had to fight for adequate PPE access at work. CEO Sam Hazen is paid 1,038 times the pay of many of the essential HCA frontline caregivers who have risked their lives to serve in a global pandemic. Right now, tens of thousands of HCA hospital workers are being paid less than $15 an hour.

HCA is the largest for-profit hospital corporation in America, and should be leading the industry on paying living wages for the healthcare heroes who have selflessly worked through exhaustion, understaffing, and inadequate PPE for more than a year. Instead, HCA workers across the country have been left fighting for a fair contract that will respect us, protect us, and pay us with the basic dignity every worker deserves.

HCA – nurses and caregivers can't afford to wait; I demand you agree to a fair contract now for frontline hospital workers.

SEIU LOCAL 200UNITED MEMBERS FILE LAWSUIT TO STOP NEW MEASURES THAT WOULD GUT PROTECTIONS FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES

Veterans Affairs hospital workers need strong unions to protect the patients in their care
Share
Post
SEIU Local 200United members who work for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs took legal action Tuesday, challenging three recent executive orders that seek to dramatically rewrite labor laws enacted by Congress to protect federal employees.
These executive orders would prevent federal employees from being able to spend any time helping their unions collectively bargain, take direct aim at the longstanding system of progressive discipline, and impose unlawful constraints on federal agency's ability to bargain. They would affect approximately 2 million federal workers across the country. 
“Those who served our country honorably come to the VA to get the care they deserve,” said Donald Woodworth, an SEIU member who has worked as a Police Officer at the Canandaigua, New York VA for 19 years. “As federal workers, we need to be united in strong unions to help protect working conditions of employees as we serve those veterans who have served us.”
The lawsuit filed on behalf of Local200United members seeks relief for working people like Donald across the country who are subject to these recent measures, and asks the court to stop these orders from going into effect.
“I love the VA and helping my fellow veterans.  I am an employee and a Ft. McClellan veteran with medical needs, I get my care at the VA too.  I give other veterans the same service I want when I go in,” said Advanced Medical Support Assistant Denise Wilson.
“This hits home with me.  We need to protect the rights of employees who help veterans who have sacrificed everything under the sun to protect the civil liberties and freedoms we enjoy every day.  If these executive orders go into effect, it’s going to have a negative impact on lots of people like me.”

Title: HCA Strike FAQ
Link: https://act.seiu.org/a/hca-strike-faq
Snippet: Our <b>hospital</b> has been given a legally-required, 10-day advance notice that we will go on strike for 10 days. If you are in the middle of patient care at 7am and there is imminent danger to a patient, you can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient before walking out at 7am on 12/24.
Body Content: Got Questions? Here are some answers
UPDATED WITH *NEW* HCA STRIKE Q&A's!
  If we work at 6am or before, do we still walk out at 7am?
Yes. Our hospital has been given a legally-required, 10-day advance notice that we will go on strike for 10 days. If you are in the middle of patient care at 7am and there is imminent danger to a patient, you can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient before walking out at 7am on 12/24. Otherwise, management must have strike staff ready to take over at 7am on the dot. That’s what the 10-day notice is for, and your employer has already published information stating they have everything ready to go to ensure continuity of care for patients, which is their legal obligation. 
  Must we call off if we are scheduled to work on the day of the strike?
No, the 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members (i.e., SEIU 121RN members) for the full 5 days of the strike, starting at 7am on Wednesday, November 22. You are not required to call in at all from 11/22 – 11/26, nor to take calls from management during the strike. Your return-to work-date/time is 7am on 1/2/2024. 
  Can I strike if I am a Per Diem?
Yes. Per Diem employees in the bargaining unit are protected by law and covered by the strike notice issued by the Union and may go on strike.
  Can I strike if I am on a leave of absence?
Yes. You are still a bargaining unit member while on leave of absence and therefore you may strike.
  I know that we’re picketing from 7am-12pm at my hospital. Should I go to work after 12pm?
No! The strike (not working at the hospital) covers the full 5-day period beginning at 7am on 12/24 and ending at 7am on 1/2. This is different from strike shifts, which apply to public actions at the hospital. No one should report to work at all from 7am on 12/24 through 1/2.  You are not required to report until 7am on January 2.
  What date, shift, and exact time should we go back to work?
All members should be ready to report at 7am on the dot on January 2. We will share additional information about returning to work before the end of the strike.
  Can we be disciplined for attendance for going out on strike?
No! By law, your employer must respect your right to strike. It is illegal for Management to terminate or retaliate against you for your participation in the strike. Furthermore, if any Manager or Director harasses you about striking, or if you feel like you are being retaliated against in any way (for voting, wearing a sticker, wearing purple), contact your Union Rep right away and we can file charges against Management with the National Labor Relations Board (a federal agency).
  Management says that I cannot talk about the strike at work. Is that true?
The hospitals cannot discriminate against employees for discussing Union matters, including the strike, when they are allowed to discuss any other non-work related matters (such as parties, events, sports, etc.) Such prohibition would be discriminatory and therefore unlawful. 
  Can friends and family attend the strike?
Of course! All supporters are encouraged to join us on the strike line.
  Will my patients be safe and taken care of if I strike?
The law requires that we give the hospital 10 days’ notice before we strike. This will give the hospital ample time to hire temporary staff. Management has already informed everyone, in writing, that  patients will be cared for by fully licensed staff.
  Can management ask me if I will be striking? 
The hospital cannot discriminate against you for discussing Union matters—including the strike—if they allow discussion of other non-work matters (like staff parties, events, sports, etc.) Doing so would be discriminatory, and therefore unlawful.  They can ask if you’re striking, but you are not required to answer.  Refusing to answer cannot be used against you as it would violate your rights to engage in protected, concerted activity.  You can also choose to tell them. It’s entirely up to you.
  I don’t want to get in trouble for patient abandonment in a critical situation. For example: if I’m at a Rapid Response or in a Code Blue (actively dying) do I hand off the patient at 7am or wait to stabilize them?
While Local 121RN has already provided the employer with the legally required 10-day advance notice for our hospital to take reasonable precautions to ensure patient safety, if a member believes that a patient is in imminent danger, they can take reasonable steps to stabilize the patient and then hand off the patient to the strike workers that your hospital has already stated they’ve hired in preparation for the strike.
  Can new grads on off-site didactic training strike?
The 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members including those in-training, and none should be disciplined or retaliated against for participating in the strike. If you are represented by 121RN, the notice covers you as well.
  If management threatens me with discipline up to termination if I don’t remove union related insignia (stickers, pins, badge buddies, etc.) what do I do?
Any discipline for wearing union insignia is discriminatory and a violation of the National Labor Rights Act, and your union has notified HCA about its obligation to the law. Meanwhile, if a manager demands that you remove your wearable union items and threatens you if you refuse to remove it, you should explain it’s your right, document the conversation, and then inform a steward or your Union Rep/Organizer so that they can refer it to our legal counsel for prompt follow-up and action.
  Management has implied that SEIU 121RN will fine me if I choose to work and don’t participate in the strike. Is that true?
No. Although your support of each other and participation in the strike shows strength and unity, SEIU Local 121RN is not going to issue fines against members who choose to work.
    Why are we going on strike?
Our Bargaining Team has worked hard to negotiate our new Union contract with hospital management, through a series of meetings that began earlier this year. We’ve proposed language to address critical issues that Nurses and Licensed Medical Professionals face at HCA hospitals—turnover at crisis levels, rampant unsafe staffing, workplace violence, and more. At the bargaining table and on the picket line we’ve stressed the gravity of these problems—but management has just deflected. We are left with no other option but to strike—as an act of protest against these unfair labor practices. It is our legal right to do so.
  But is a strike really necessary?
Your bargaining team would like to settle the contract as soon as possible, and we hope that management will return to the table with acceptable proposals in response to the important issues we’ve raised. Your bargaining team has determined that a strike is the necessary next-step.
  Do I have to Strike?
The expectation is that you will honor the picket line. To truly show unity, you should not come to work, and you should sign up to join the picket line as often as you can.
  Can the Hospital discipline or terminate me if I strike and join the picket line?
By law, your employer must respect your right to strike. It is illegal for Management to terminate or retaliate against you for your participation in the strike. If any Manager or Director harasses you about striking, or if you feel like you are being retaliated against in any way (for voting, wearing a sticker, wearing purple), contact your Union Rep right away and we can file charges against Management with the National Labor Relations Board.
  Are 90-day probationary RNs expected to strike?
The 10-day notice covers all bargaining unit members including those in training, and none should be disciplined or retaliated against for participating in the strike. IF you are represented by SEIU 121RN, the notice covers you as well. 
  Will my patients be safe and taken care of if I strike?
The law requires that we give the hospital 10 days’ notice before we strike. This will give the hospital ample time to hire temporary staff. Our patients will be cared for by fully licensed staff.
  Will I be covered by my health insurance during the strike?
Health insurance premiums are paid at the beginning of the month and remain in effect all month.
  Can we be locked out?
The hospital can have a “lock-out”, an exclusion of employees from the workplace during a labor dispute. However, they can’t lock us out in retaliation for going on strike. That would be illegal. And they can’t replace us for striking in protest of their unfair labor practices.
  Can my vacation be canceled if there is a strike?
No, your vacation cannot be canceled. If management cancels your vacation, it can be considered an act of retaliation and discrimination and could be chargeable under the National Labor Relations Act (federal law).  If this happens, inform a Steward or your Union Rep/Organizer right away. 
  Can I use PTO while on strike?
Unless your PTO request has been pre-approved, management may deny your PTO request for the days we strike. Also, note that under the CBA you can cash out PTO at any time (may take 1 pay cycle to pay out. Minimum of 8 hours cashed out. May cash out down to 40 hours in the bank.)
  Do I need to call the hospital on days we’re on strike?
No. As a healthcare facility, our Union is required by law to give 10 days’ notice of when we will go on strike to the hospital and to tell the hospital when we will return.  We, as a Union, will take care of this notice on behalf of our members.
  Will night shift workers be walking the picket line at night?
Due to safety concerns, night shift workers will not picket at night. Night shift workers will, however, be expected to be on the picket line during daytime hours. We will be signing people up for picketing times.
  What is the National Relations Labor Board (NLRB)?
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is comprised of a team of professionals who work to assure fair labor practices and workplace democracy nationwide. Since its creation by Congress in 1935, this small, highly respected, independent Federal agency has had daily impact on the way America's companies, industries and unions conduct business. Agency staff members investigate and remedy unfair labor practices by unions and employers. For more information, please visit nlrb.gov.

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”

Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.

KENNY KEMP/CHARLESTON GAZETTE-MAIL VIA AP, FILE
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

West Virginia Hospital Retirees Cleared for $5.6 Million Deal
Jacklyn Wille
Legal Reporter
Longtime workers allegedly promised lifetime health coverage
Settlement covers 210 non-union retirees
Retirees of West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. received final approval for a $5.6 million class settlement in their federal lawsuit challenging proposed cuts to their health coverage.
The deal provides payments of nearly $19,000 to each of 210 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be curtailed or terminated. It also creates a $500,000 “high risk fund” to help cover certain prescription drug costs not otherwise covered by a retiree’s Medicare Part D plan, and it allows the three class representatives to receive service awards of $15,000 each.

Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

West Virginia Hospital Retirees Cleared for $5.6 Million Deal
Jacklyn Wille
Legal Reporter
Longtime workers allegedly promised lifetime health coverage
Settlement covers 210 non-union retirees
Retirees of West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. received final approval for a $5.6 million class settlement in their federal lawsuit challenging proposed cuts to their health coverage.
The deal provides payments of nearly $19,000 to each of 210 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be curtailed or terminated. It also creates a $500,000 “high risk fund” to help cover certain prescription drug costs not otherwise covered by a retiree’s Medicare Part D plan, and it allows the three class representatives to receive service awards of $15,000 each.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL PLANS NEW MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING TO ENHANCE PATIENT ACCESS
Cabell Huntington Hospital plans new medical office building to enhance patient access
Monday, August 23, 2021
Construction of a new medical office building (MOB) on the campus of Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) is scheduled to begin in August. When complete, the new facility will house multiple services including physical therapy, neurology services, physician offices, endoscopy, lab and imaging services.
“From its inception this facility’s intent and design have been to enhance patient access to the most frequently used outpatient services
at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer of CHH. “It will feature a convenient drop-off area that opens into a welcoming lobby with floor to ceiling windows.”
The MOB will be constructed on the main campus of CHH, adjacent to the parking garage. The new structure will be five floors totaling approximately 75,000 square feet of space with two access walkways – one from the parking garage and one to Marshall Health and the main hospital.
“Patients and visitors who park in the campus parking garage never need to go outside for their appointments,” Martin explained. “The walkway connectors offer protection from the outside elements in a
climate-controlled atmosphere.”
MIRC Construction Services, LLC., a local construction company based in Hurricane, WV, will lead the $51 million project with an anticipated completion date of August 2024.
“We are pleased to support our local economy through hiring local contractors and subcontractors such as MIRC and Ed Tucker Architects,” said Martin. “This keeps local dollars local.”

CHH RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONNECT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS
CHH receives federal funding to connect community organizations
Monday, March 28, 2022
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network (MHN), has received $267,000 in federal funding as part of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations omnibus package. The funding recently was announced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“The mission of Mountain Health Network is to improve the well-being of all we serve through understanding, respecting and meeting their health needs,” said Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP, CEO, MHN and president, CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC). “We are so grateful to Sen. Capito, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, and Congresswoman Carol Miller for their continued commitment to our community by supporting that mission.”
The hospital will use the funds to purchase software that will enable FaithHealth Appalachia and other community organizations to connect through a shared technology platform that enables them to send and receive electronic referrals to address people’s social needs and improve health across communities.
“From its beginnings, FaithHealth Appalachia has existed to be a conduit of transformation by connecting faith communities, social service organizations and medical facilities to improve the total health of our neighbors,” said Rory Chapman, executive director of FaithHealth Appalachia. “Too often, we hear about folks falling through the cracks, or not getting the help they need simply because they lack information. We want to ensure people get the right information, so they access the right door at the right time.”
The software platform, called Unite US, is a national technology infrastructure with a presence in West Virginia that standardizes how health and social care providers communicate and track outcomes together.
“Unite West Virginia, and the entire Unite US platform, will be incredible tools that will assist us in our mission of connection in the Huntington and greater Tri-State community,” Chapman said. “It will enable us to better streamline our efforts in getting people the help they need, when and where they need it most. We hope to further our mission to better bridge the gaps within our communities and see less people falling through the cracks.”
The software will allow MHN member hospitals to join other community organizations to address social determinants of health such as food insecurity, transportation and other issues that impede their ability to thrive.
Community and social organizations that would like to connect with FaithHealth Appalachia may contact Rory Chapman at rory.chapman@chhi.org or 304-416-2098.

PLEASANT VALLEY HOSPITAL AND CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL BOARDS APPROVE FIRST STEP TOWARD JOINING MOUNTAIN HEALTH NETWORK
Pleasant Valley Hospital and Cabell Huntington Hospital boards approve first step toward joining Mountain Health Network
Thursday, June 2, 2022
Enhanced services and physician recruitment planned
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) and Pleasant Valley Hospital (PVH) have signed a Letter of Intent, effective May 31, 2022, to solidify and expand their relationship from their 2013 Management Services Agreement by joining CHH and becoming a part of the Mountain Health Network.
“Our goal is to ensure access to advanced medicine and compassionate care for all residents of Mason, Jackson, Gallia and Meigs counties,” stated Mountain Health Network CEO Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP.  “Key to the acquisition is maintaining Pleasant Valley Hospital as an acute care hospital with emergency services. Thanks to the commitment of our academic medical center partner, increased access to medical specialties will be supported through Marshall Health and graduate medical education programs will be provided by Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine. Additionally, we plan to enhance telehealth services and connect PVH to our electronic health platform.”
The agreement calls for the investment of $25 million in Mason County by Cabell, which will include upgrades to PVH’s information technology platform, renovations to the PVH emergency department, an investment in physician residency training programs in partnership with the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and Marshall Health, additional physician recruitment, and other needed PVH facility renovations. In addition, PVH and its Board of Trustees plan to contribute an estimated $14 million to be used by Cabell toward capital improvement projects at PVH. A total of upwards of $39 million will be invested in PVH over the next five years.
“The PVH Board members have not made this decision lightly,” stated Peter Allinder, chair of the PVH Board of Trustees. “We recognize our responsibility to our community. With so many positive changes in Mason County and the surrounding area, the timing is right for Pleasant Valley Hospital to take the next step with Mountain Health Network to advance our future in caring for our community.”
Over the next several weeks, the two entities will work to develop a Definitive Agreement. Following execution of the Definitive Agreement and regulatory approvals, PVH will join CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center as a member of Mountain Health Network.

CABELL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PRESENTS $1.2M TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS
HUNTINGTON — The Cabell-Huntington Health Department presented three of its community partners with $1.2 million on Tuesday to reimburse them for their COVID-19 testing efforts.
Tuesday morning, the health department presented COVID-19 testing partners Marshall University, Marshall Health and Mountain Health Network with a check for the funds, which were secured through the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
“Emergency response, it’s all local,” said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, chief executive officer and health officer for the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, who presented the check alongside Tim Hazelett, chief operating office for the health department. “It starts local and it ends local and that all happens before we get any help and before anything else occurs.”
Kilkenny said the check presentation event celebrated a symbol of the help that is coming at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I can say that, in Cabell County, if you say ‘all hands on deck,’ you had better have a truckload of work gloves, because they’re all gonna show up,” Kilkenny said. “But that all has a cost and that cost was put up front by the agencies that are represented here as a portion of the reimbursement that’s coming to this community for what has already been spent in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Kevin Yingling, chief executive officer of Mountain Health Network and president of Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center, reflected on the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the individuals “who were instrumental” in that time and the health department’s response. He said he never before had seen public health be the leader of unifying a medical school, a health care system and a Division I university into one effort.
“The most important letters in our name, West Virginia, are the first two, we,” Marshall President Brad D. Smith said. “And the first important word in the rally cry ‘We Are Marshall’ is the first word, ‘we.’ And I think that this reaction, that we pull together to fight a pandemic, it’s emblematic of everything we are in our community.”
Beth Hammers, chief executive officer of Marshall Health and chief administrative officer of Marshall’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine described community partnerships as “invaluable.”
“It was about this time last year, when we closed our community testing tents, about two years and 70,000 COVID tests later, right,” Hammers said. “That’s a lot. And that was for one site only, right. I would like to recognize and thank the faculty, the staff, medical students and resident physicians who worked tirelessly with our friends at Mountain Health Network. Together, they worked the tents through extreme weather conditions, and they banded together to distribute and administer vaccinations.”
Kilkenny said, aside from the FEMA reimbursement money, a lot of COVID-19 testing was reimbursed in other ways, such as the CARES Act and the American Recovery Act, but the cost of the response exceeded that.
U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., all who had representatives at the event on Tuesday, played a role in the approval and appropriation of the reimbursement money received from FEMA, Kilkenny said.
“This is a small percentage of the amount of money that we are expecting to bring back into Cabell County in order to make whole the expenditures of all of our partner agencies that put that effort up front, and we’re so glad to have the support from Congress to pay that back,” Kilkenny said.
Other community partners who aided in COVID-19 pandemic response include Valley Health, the Cabell County Board of Education, Cabell County Emergency Medical Services and the Wayne County Health Department, Kilkenny said.
Cabell County lost more than 400 people to COVID-19 over the last three years, said Hazelett, who led a moment of silence in their memory during the event Tuesday.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL PLANS NEW MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING TO ENHANCE PATIENT ACCESS
Cabell Huntington Hospital plans new medical office building to enhance patient access
Monday, August 23, 2021
Construction of a new medical office building (MOB) on the campus of Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) is scheduled to begin in August. When complete, the new facility will house multiple services including physical therapy, neurology services, physician offices, endoscopy, lab and imaging services.
“From its inception this facility’s intent and design have been to enhance patient access to the most frequently used outpatient services
at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer of CHH. “It will feature a convenient drop-off area that opens into a welcoming lobby with floor to ceiling windows.”
The MOB will be constructed on the main campus of CHH, adjacent to the parking garage. The new structure will be five floors totaling approximately 75,000 square feet of space with two access walkways – one from the parking garage and one to Marshall Health and the main hospital.
“Patients and visitors who park in the campus parking garage never need to go outside for their appointments,” Martin explained. “The walkway connectors offer protection from the outside elements in a
climate-controlled atmosphere.”
MIRC Construction Services, LLC., a local construction company based in Hurricane, WV, will lead the $51 million project with an anticipated completion date of August 2024.
“We are pleased to support our local economy through hiring local contractors and subcontractors such as MIRC and Ed Tucker Architects,” said Martin. “This keeps local dollars local.”

CHH RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONNECT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS
CHH receives federal funding to connect community organizations
Monday, March 28, 2022
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network (MHN), has received $267,000 in federal funding as part of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations omnibus package. The funding recently was announced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“The mission of Mountain Health Network is to improve the well-being of all we serve through understanding, respecting and meeting their health needs,” said Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP, CEO, MHN and president, CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC). “We are so grateful to Sen. Capito, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, and Congresswoman Carol Miller for their continued commitment to our community by supporting that mission.”
The hospital will use the funds to purchase software that will enable FaithHealth Appalachia and other community organizations to connect through a shared technology platform that enables them to send and receive electronic referrals to address people’s social needs and improve health across communities.
“From its beginnings, FaithHealth Appalachia has existed to be a conduit of transformation by connecting faith communities, social service organizations and medical facilities to improve the total health of our neighbors,” said Rory Chapman, executive director of FaithHealth Appalachia. “Too often, we hear about folks falling through the cracks, or not getting the help they need simply because they lack information. We want to ensure people get the right information, so they access the right door at the right time.”
The software platform, called Unite US, is a national technology infrastructure with a presence in West Virginia that standardizes how health and social care providers communicate and track outcomes together.
“Unite West Virginia, and the entire Unite US platform, will be incredible tools that will assist us in our mission of connection in the Huntington and greater Tri-State community,” Chapman said. “It will enable us to better streamline our efforts in getting people the help they need, when and where they need it most. We hope to further our mission to better bridge the gaps within our communities and see less people falling through the cracks.”
The software will allow MHN member hospitals to join other community organizations to address social determinants of health such as food insecurity, transportation and other issues that impede their ability to thrive.
Community and social organizations that would like to connect with FaithHealth Appalachia may contact Rory Chapman at rory.chapman@chhi.org or 304-416-2098.

PLEASANT VALLEY HOSPITAL AND CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL BOARDS APPROVE FIRST STEP TOWARD JOINING MOUNTAIN HEALTH NETWORK
Pleasant Valley Hospital and Cabell Huntington Hospital boards approve first step toward joining Mountain Health Network
Thursday, June 2, 2022
Enhanced services and physician recruitment planned
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) and Pleasant Valley Hospital (PVH) have signed a Letter of Intent, effective May 31, 2022, to solidify and expand their relationship from their 2013 Management Services Agreement by joining CHH and becoming a part of the Mountain Health Network.
“Our goal is to ensure access to advanced medicine and compassionate care for all residents of Mason, Jackson, Gallia and Meigs counties,” stated Mountain Health Network CEO Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP.  “Key to the acquisition is maintaining Pleasant Valley Hospital as an acute care hospital with emergency services. Thanks to the commitment of our academic medical center partner, increased access to medical specialties will be supported through Marshall Health and graduate medical education programs will be provided by Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine. Additionally, we plan to enhance telehealth services and connect PVH to our electronic health platform.”
The agreement calls for the investment of $25 million in Mason County by Cabell, which will include upgrades to PVH’s information technology platform, renovations to the PVH emergency department, an investment in physician residency training programs in partnership with the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and Marshall Health, additional physician recruitment, and other needed PVH facility renovations. In addition, PVH and its Board of Trustees plan to contribute an estimated $14 million to be used by Cabell toward capital improvement projects at PVH. A total of upwards of $39 million will be invested in PVH over the next five years.
“The PVH Board members have not made this decision lightly,” stated Peter Allinder, chair of the PVH Board of Trustees. “We recognize our responsibility to our community. With so many positive changes in Mason County and the surrounding area, the timing is right for Pleasant Valley Hospital to take the next step with Mountain Health Network to advance our future in caring for our community.”
Over the next several weeks, the two entities will work to develop a Definitive Agreement. Following execution of the Definitive Agreement and regulatory approvals, PVH will join CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center as a member of Mountain Health Network.

CABELL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PRESENTS $1.2M TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS
HUNTINGTON — The Cabell-Huntington Health Department presented three of its community partners with $1.2 million on Tuesday to reimburse them for their COVID-19 testing efforts.
Tuesday morning, the health department presented COVID-19 testing partners Marshall University, Marshall Health and Mountain Health Network with a check for the funds, which were secured through the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Kilkenny said the check presentation event celebrated a symbol of the help that is coming at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I can say that, in Cabell County, if you say ‘all hands on deck,’ you had better have a truckload of work gloves, because they’re all gonna show up,” Kilkenny said. “But that all has a cost and that cost was put up front by the agencies that are represented here as a portion of the reimbursement that’s coming to this community for what has already been spent in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Cabell County lost more than 400 people to COVID-19 over the last three years, said Hazelett, who led a moment of silence in their memory during the event Tuesday.

Error handling Remi's results: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
Susan: Based on Remi's search results, here are some follow-up questions to further clarify and gather more detailed information:

### Financial Information
1. **ProPublica Financial Data:**
   - Could we obtain the actual Form 990 documents or summary charts from ProPublica for a more detailed review of the financials, and to cross-check any major financial figures like net revenue and expenses?

2. **Moody's Rating:**
   - Could we get the full Moody’s report that discusses Cabell Huntington Hospital's bond ratings and outlook? This might give more insight into the financial health and investment risk associated with the hospital.

### Leadership
1. **Leadership Team:**
   - The Cabell Huntington Hospital website and LinkedIn provided some information on key executives. Can we gather detailed biographies and possibly past employment history for these key figures to identify any past issues or leverage points?

2. **Recent Leadership Changes:**
   - Have there been any recent notable appointments or resignations among the hospital's leadership? This can be indicative of internal shifts or instability.

### Labor Relations
1. **Union Relations:**
   - From the information on labor disputes and union relations, can we access specific details on the outcomes of any negotiations or strikes? This will help us understand current labor relations status and any existing tensions.
   - What specific agreements were reached between the Cabell Huntington Hospital and SEIU, especially regarding wages and working conditions?

### Notable News and Scandals
1. **Opioid Lawsuit:**
   - The opioid lawsuit was a significant issue. Can we get more in-depth information on the case's implications, perhaps focusing on the hospital’s role and any ongoing impact?
   
2. **Medical Records Misuse:**
   - The lawsuit regarding improper access to medical records could have major implications. Any detailed filings or outcomes related to this case would be beneficial.

3. **Medicare Penalties:**
   - The repeat Medicare penalties could indicate systemic issues with patient care. Can we get more detailed reports on the specific failures leading to these penalties and any steps the hospital has taken to remedy them?

### Community Projects and Partnerships
1. **Community Partnerships:**
   - Regarding the partnerships and community projects, can we obtain more detailed information about the roles and contributions of each partner in these projects?
   - Specifically, for projects like the new medical office building and Federal funding for community organization connectivity, what are the expected timelines and goals, and who are the primary people responsible for these initiatives?

### Strategy and Planning
1. **Future Financial Planning:**
   - Do the financial and annual reports detail any future financial planning or investments that the hospital aims to undertake? Understanding their strategic initiatives could give insight into their priorities and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - How does Cabell Huntington Hospital engage with its stakeholders, including employees, community members, and patients? Any reports or data on stakeholder satisfaction would be helpful.

### General Clarifications
1. **Documentation Access:**
   - Can we have access to PDFs or full reports of any significant documents, especially those mentioned in articles or news snippets?

2. **Data Verification:**
   - Would it be possible to access third-party verification of data such as financial performance and quality metrics to ensure credibility?

By addressing these questions, we can enrich our research with specific, actionable insights that will support a detailed and strategic briefing on Cabell Huntington Hospital.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Full text of "Full Filing" for fiscal year ending Sept. 2020
Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Full text of "Full Filing" for fiscal year ending Sept. 2020
Tax returns filed by nonprofit organizations are public records. The Internal Revenue Service releases them in two formats: page images and raw data in XML. The raw data is more useful, especially to researchers, because it can be extracted and analyzed more easily. The pages below are a reconstruction of a tax document using raw data from the IRS.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV -- Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmed
Moody's
Fri, Feb 11, 202213 min read
Rating Action: Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmedGlobal Credit Research - 11 Feb 2022New York, February 11, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service affirmed Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc's (Cabell) (WV) Baa1 revenue bond rating. The outlook is revised to negative from stable. Cabell had approximately $338 million in outstanding debt at fiscal year end 2021.RATINGS RATIONALEAffirmation of the Baa1 rating reflects Cabell's leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's Medical Center. Margins will also be constrained by the system's weak service area and high concentration of government payors that results in a high dependency on supplemental payment programs. Despite cash softening due to revenue cycle disruptions following an IT conversion, debt coverage metrics will remain solid.RATING OUTLOOKThe revision of the outlook to negative reflects the material departure from historical operating performance, as well as budget, and the expected persistence of labor-related expense pressures. An inability to restore operating cash flow to higher levels, and/or a notable decline in liquidity metrics would likely pressure the rating.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Material and durable improvement in operating performance- Strengthening of liquidity and leverage metricsFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Inability to build operating performance to levels more in line with historical levels- Decline in liquidity that results in weakened metrics- Increase in financial leverage without commensurate increase in cash flowLEGAL SECURITYCabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center, Inc. comprise the obligated group on all parity obligations. The bonds are secured by a pledge of gross receipts. Covenants under the amended and restated Master Trust Indenture include a maximum annual debt service coverage test of 1.10 times which would trigger a consultant call-in; coverage that is below 1.0 times for two consecutive years is an event of default.PROFILECabell Huntington Hospital is a regional referral center with over 300 beds and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Marshall University Joan C.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis following downgrade

Published Mar 28, 2023
...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (Cabell; Baa2 negative) credit profile reflects material cash flow weakening in fiscal 2022 that has resulted in a measurable degradation of balance sheet metrics. Cash flow losses are largely due to ongoing labor challenges, which were intensified by a month-long strike of the services workers union in November 2021. Although labor expenses are expected to moderate from recent highs, margins will remain constrained in fiscal 2023 by the system's weak service area demographics, slow volume recovery, and other inflationary pressures. Furthermore, balance sheet metrics, particularly days cash and cash to total debt, will remain weak relative to similarly rated peers. Favorably, Cabell has identified various cost saving opportunities, which will help improve margins, and capital spending is expected to be manageable. Other factors supporting the rating include Cabell's leading market position over a broad service area and its role as the primary teaching...

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2022/02/16 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital (Cabell; Baa1 negative) will continue to benefit from its leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's...

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2019/11/26 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. (Cabell; Baa1 stable) will maintain a favorable market position with a leading share on over a large geographic area. Near term performance is expected to improve while operating under the regulatory framework established under the State of West Virginia. We expect ongoing improvement at St. Mary's Medical Center and the system as synergies and integration savings are realized beginning in fiscal 2020. However, the pace of operating improvement will be slowed by a planned electronic medical record implementation at Cabell Huntington Hospital in the coming year, and at St. Mary's Medical Center in subsequent years. The organization will continue to see benefits from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of Marshall University and wide draw for tertiary services. Offsets will include ongoing integration and execution risks and challenging service area demographics. Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. includes subsidiaries St. Mary's Medical...
Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2018/08/15 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital (Baa1 stable) will have a distinctly leading market position over a large geographic area through the completed acquisition of St. Mary's Medical Center. Although near term performance will be suppressed, Cabell has built capacity to absorb the acquisition, and will create opportunity for service line development and synergies over time. The organization will also benefit from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of the Marshall University School of Medicine and wide draw for tertiary services. Both systems have been planning for this merger for five years, which speaks to the strong commitment to ensure the integration will be successful. Key challenges include improving performance at St. Mary's, which will suppress system results in 2018 and into 2019. Risks will include the ability of the system to coalesce and gain synergies that will support improved margins over time and managing within the restrictions of the Certificate of Approval...

Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the "Baa1" bond rating assigned to Huntington, W. Va.-based Cabell Huntington Hospital's bonds.
Here are four things to know about the rating action and the hospital's outlook.
1. The rating action affects approximately $88.6 million of debt.
2. The rating affirmation was supported by a number of factors, including Cabell's strengthening market share, position as a teaching hospital and provider of higher acuity services across a broad service area, better performance in interim fiscal year 2015, favorable balance sheet metrics and healthy debt service coverage metrics, according to Moody's.
3. Cabell also faces challenges, which were considered for the rating affirmation, such as a history of inconsistent financial performance, heavy use of demand debt and high Medicaid exposure.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis following downgrade - Credit Opinion – 2023/03/28 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (Cabell; Baa2 negative) credit profile reflects material cash flow weakening in fiscal 2022 that has resulted in a measurable degradation of balance sheet metrics. Cash flow losses are largely due to ongoing labor challenges, which were intensified by a month-long strike of the services workers union in November 2021. Although labor expenses are expected to moderate from recent highs, margins will remain constrained in fiscal 2023 by the system's weak service area demographics, slow volume recovery, and other inflationary pressures. Furthermore, balance sheet metrics, particularly days cash and cash to total debt, will remain weak relative to similarly rated peers. Favorably, Cabell has identified various cost saving opportunities, which will help improve margins, and capital spending is expected to be manageable. Other factors supporting the rating include Cabell's leading market position over a broad service area and its role as the primary teaching...

However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies.

Near term performance is expected to improve while operating under the regulatory framework established under the State of West Virginia.

However, the pace of operating improvement will be slowed by a planned electronic medical record implementation at Cabell Huntington Hospital in the coming year, and at St. Mary's Medical Center in subsequent years. The organization will continue to see benefits from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of Marshall University and wide draw for tertiary services. Offsets will include ongoing integration and execution risks and challenging service area demographics. Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. includes subsidiaries St. Mary's Medical...

Although near term performance will be suppressed, Cabell has built capacity to absorb the acquisition, and will create opportunity for service line development and synergies over time. The organization will also benefit from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of the Marshall University School of Medicine and wide draw for tertiary services. Both systems have been planning for this merger for five years, which speaks to the strong commitment to ensure the integration will be successful. Key challenges include improving performance at St. Mary's, which will suppress system results in 2018 and into 2019. Risks will include the ability of the system to coalesce and gain synergies that will support improved margins over time and managing within the restrictions of the Certificate of Approval...

Rating Action: Moody's revises Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (WV) outlook to negative; Baa1 affirmedGlobal Credit Research - 11 Feb 2022New York, February 11, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service affirmed Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc's (Cabell) (WV) Baa1 revenue bond rating. The outlook is revised to negative from stable. Cabell had approximately $338 million in outstanding debt at fiscal year end 2021.RATINGS RATIONALEAffirmation of the Baa1 rating reflects Cabell's leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's Medical Center. Margins will also be constrained by the system's weak service area and high concentration of government payors that results in a high dependency on supplemental payment programs. Despite cash softening due to revenue cycle disruptions following an IT conversion, debt coverage metrics will remain solid.RATING OUTLOOKThe revision of the outlook to negative reflects the material departure from historical operating performance, as well as budget, and the expected persistence of labor-related expense pressures. An inability to restore operating cash flow to higher levels, and/or a notable decline in liquidity metrics would likely pressure the rating.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Material and durable improvement in operating performance- Strengthening of liquidity and leverage metricsFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS- Inability to build operating performance to levels more in line with historical levels- Decline in liquidity that results in weakened metrics- Increase in financial leverage without commensurate increase in cash flowLEGAL SECURITYCabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center, Inc. comprise the obligated group on all parity obligations. The bonds are secured by a pledge of gross receipts. Covenants under the amended and restated Master Trust Indenture include a maximum annual debt service coverage test of 1.10 times which would trigger a consultant call-in; coverage that is below 1.0 times for two consecutive years is an event of default.PROFILECabell Huntington Hospital is a regional referral center with over 300 beds and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine. In May 2018, Cabell became the sole member of St. Mary's Medical Center, a tertiary care hospital with 393 beds. Both hospitals are located in Huntington, WV. In addition to the hospitals, the system owns various outpatient sites, and is the largest healthcare system in the primary service area. The combined system saw 40,887 inpatient admissions in FY 2021 and over 30,000 surgeries.Cabell Huntington is also the sole member of Mountain Health Network, Inc. which provides management services and strategic planning for the system.METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Not-For-Profit Healthcare published in December 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1154632.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis following downgrade

Published Mar 28, 2023
...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (Cabell; Baa2 negative) credit profile reflects material cash flow weakening in fiscal 2022 that has resulted in a measurable degradation of balance sheet metrics. Cash flow losses are largely due to ongoing labor challenges, which were intensified by a month-long strike of the services workers union in November 2021. Although labor expenses are expected to moderate from recent highs, margins will remain constrained in fiscal 2023 by the system's weak service area demographics, slow volume recovery, and other inflationary pressures. Furthermore, balance sheet metrics, particularly days cash and cash to total debt, will remain weak relative to similarly rated peers. Favorably, Cabell has identified various cost saving opportunities, which will help improve margins, and capital spending is expected to be manageable. Other factors supporting the rating include Cabell's leading market position over a broad service area and its role as the primary teaching...

However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's...

Near term performance is expected to improve while operating under the regulatory framework established under the State of West Virginia. We expect ongoing improvement at St. Mary's Medical Center and the system as synergies and integration savings are realized beginning in fiscal 2020. However, the pace of operating improvement will be slowed by a planned electronic medical record implementation at Cabell Huntington Hospital in the coming year, and at St. Mary's Medical Center in subsequent years. The organization will continue to see benefits from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of Marshall University and wide draw for tertiary services.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2018/08/15 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital (Baa1 stable) will have a distinctly leading market position over a large geographic area through the completed acquisition of St. Mary's Medical Center. Although near term performance will be suppressed, Cabell has built capacity to absorb the acquisition, and will create opportunity for service line development and synergies over time. The organization will also benefit from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of the Marshall University School of Medicine and wide draw for tertiary services. Both systems have been planning for this merger for five years, which speaks to the strong commitment to ensure the integration will be successful. Key challenges include improving performance at St. Mary's, which will suppress system results in 2018 and into 2019. Risks will include the ability of the system to coalesce and gain synergies that will support improved margins over time and managing within the restrictions of the Certificate of Approval...

Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the "Baa1" bond rating assigned to Huntington, W. Va.-based Cabell Huntington Hospital's bonds.
Here are four things to know about the rating action and the hospital's outlook.
1. The rating action affects approximately $88.6 million of debt.
2. The rating affirmation was supported by a number of factors, including Cabell's strengthening market share, position as a teaching hospital and provider of higher acuity services across a broad service area, better performance in interim fiscal year 2015, favorable balance sheet metrics and healthy debt service coverage metrics, according to Moody's.
3. Cabell also faces challenges, which were considered for the rating affirmation, such as a history of inconsistent financial performance, heavy use of demand debt and high Medicaid exposure.

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis following downgrade - Credit Opinion – 2023/03/28 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc.'s (Cabell; Baa2 negative) credit profile reflects material cash flow weakening in fiscal 2022 that has resulted in a measurable degradation of balance sheet metrics. Cash flow losses are largely due to ongoing labor challenges, which were intensified by a month-long strike of the services workers union in November 2021. Although labor expenses are expected to moderate from recent highs, margins will remain constrained in fiscal 2023 by the system's weak service area demographics, slow volume recovery, and other inflationary pressures. Furthermore, balance sheet metrics, particularly days cash and cash to total debt, will remain weak relative to similarly rated peers. Favorably, Cabell has identified various cost saving opportunities, which will help improve margins, and capital spending is expected to be manageable. Other factors supporting the rating include Cabell's leading market position over a broad service area and its role as the primary teaching...

Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2022/02/16 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital (Cabell; Baa1 negative) will continue to benefit from its leading market position across a broad service area supported by its role as the primary teaching hospital for Marshall University, which should allow for a steady rebuild of margins in FY 2022 and stronger cashflow then generated in FY 2021. However, strong headwinds will persist with ongoing labor challenges, which were marked by a month-long strike of the service workers' union in the first quarter of FY 2022. Though the strike and union contract are resolved, staff shortages, exacerbated by local and national competition, will continue to drive higher costs to recruit and retain labor, with Cabell resorting to the use of expensive staffing agencies to supplement labor deficiencies. Mitigating some of these expense pressures, will be the system's continued strategic initiatives to grow and improve key service lines and a focus on cost containment following the integration and consolidation of St. Mary's...
Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2019/11/26 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. (Cabell; Baa1 stable) will maintain a favorable market position with a leading share on over a large geographic area. Near term performance is expected to improve while operating under the regulatory framework established under the State of West Virginia. We expect ongoing improvement at St. Mary's Medical Center and the system as synergies and integration savings are realized beginning in fiscal 2020. However, the pace of operating improvement will be slowed by a planned electronic medical record implementation at Cabell Huntington Hospital in the coming year, and at St. Mary's Medical Center in subsequent years. The organization will continue to see benefits from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of Marshall University and wide draw for tertiary services. Offsets will include ongoing integration and execution risks and challenging service area demographics. Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. includes subsidiaries St. Mary's Medical...
Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., WV: Update to credit analysis - Credit Opinion – 2018/08/15 – US$ 250.00 – ...Cabell Huntington Hospital (Baa1 stable) will have a distinctly leading market position over a large geographic area through the completed acquisition of St. Mary's Medical Center. Although near term performance will be suppressed, Cabell has built capacity to absorb the acquisition, and will create opportunity for service line development and synergies over time. The organization will also benefit from a long-standing relationship as a primary teaching affiliate of the Marshall University School of Medicine and wide draw for tertiary services. Both systems have been planning for this merger for five years, which speaks to the strong commitment to ensure the integration will be successful. Key challenges include improving performance at St. Mary's, which will suppress system results in 2018 and into 2019. Risks will include the ability of the system to coalesce and gain synergies that will support improved margins over time and managing within the restrictions of the Certificate of Approval...

Nearly 100 health care leaders, state dignitaries and community members joined together today at Cabell Huntington Hospital for the unveiling of the newly named Robert and Lena Shell Outpatient Medical Pavilion. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the hospital’s main campus with a special dedication honoring the Shell family, a prominent Huntington family recognized for its significant commitment to Marshall Health Network.

Todd Shell, son of the late Robert "Bob" Shell, said Father’s Day weekend was the perfect time to make this announcement to honor his father's legacy. He added, "We are here today because of the love, dedication, hard work, long hours and absolute devotion to my dad’s health care. We are so grateful to the hospitals, the physicians and the staff of Marshall Health Network.”

Earlier today, members of Cabell Huntington Hospital's leadership team joined representatives from Marshall Health, MIRC Construction Services, LLC and Edward Tucker Architects, Inc. for a “Steel Top Out” ceremony, which marked the end of the steel erection portion of construction on the hospital's brand new Medical Office Building (MOB). Celebrating this milestone is a tradition in construction in which a steel beam is signed, raised and put in place. 

The MOB is being constructed on the main campus of Cabell Huntington Hospital, adjacent to the parking garage. The new structure will be five floors totaling approximately 75,000 square feet of space with two access walkways – one from the parking garage and one to Marshall Health and the main hospital. The MOB project as of now is slightly ahead of schedule.

Biography
An antitrust M&A specialist, first-chair trial lawyer, and former senior Federal Trade Commission official, Mark Seidman has nearly 20 years of antitrust agency experience providing him with an unparalleled perspective into how the government investigates and litigates antitrust cases.
During his time at the FTC, Mark oversaw hundreds of merger investigations and, in his most recent position as head of the Mergers IV Division, was the lead government enforcer for transactions in a broad variety of sectors including the retail, consumer products, grocery, casino, and health care services industries. His agency experience has allowed him to work closely with regulators around the world, developing relationships that are invaluable given the increasing globalization of the merger review process. Likewise, Mark has also worked closely with state-level antitrust enforcers, especially as many state attorneys general have become more active in antitrust enforcement. Mark’s participation in the development of the FTC’s merger enforcement priorities, litigation strategies, and theories of antitrust harm allow him to provide practical, real-world guidance clients need to inform their business and M&A strategies.
Beyond his role as an antitrust enforcer, Mark has also been a first-chair litigator with extensive trial experience in FTC merger cases. He has played a leading role in several of the FTC’s most prominent merger litigations, including Sysco/US Foods, Cabell Huntington Hospital/St. Mary’s Medical Center, DraftKings/FanDuel, and J.M. Smucker/Conagra. He served as lead trial counsel in the FTC’s federal court challenges of Jefferson Health/Einstein Healthcare Network and Louisiana Children’s Medical Center/HCA, and he supervised numerous additional merger investigations and litigations across a range of industries.
Mark also guided numerous merger investigations to consent agreements while at the Commission. These settlements enabled mergers to proceed following divestitures of assets that created antitrust concerns. Although such consent agreements have been subject to increased scrutiny by the antitrust agencies, Mark has successfully negotiated and navigated the Commission’s internal process to finalize these settlements. Under the current administration, Mark and his team handled the consent agreements in Price Chopper/Tops and Tractor Supply/Orscheln, two of a small number of merger consents approved in recent years.
In addition to his leadership experience at the FTC, Mark has held several other key roles in government. For two years, Mark was Counsel to the Director of the Bureau of Competition at the FTC, where he advised the Bureau’s leadership and worked closely with agency officials, including the Commissioners’ offices, the Office of General Counsel, and the Office of Policy Planning. Mark also served as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia. In this role, Mark first-chaired approximately two dozen criminal bench trials. Mark began his antitrust career as a staff attorney in the FTC’s Mergers I Division, where he investigated mergers involving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, defense and aerospace products, Internet technology, and industrial services.
Mark has been a leading voice in competition policy across the federal government, with state governments, and internationally. As the leader of the Mergers IV Division, Mark was frequently called upon to brief the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee on his division’s investigations and competition policy issues. He also interacted with state attorneys general on investigations and policy issues, and he testified at public hearings as an FTC representative. Mark has also engaged with competition enforcers across the globe, including the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil.
Over the course of his career in government, Mark has been a frequent commentator, both as a speaker and writer. Mark has been a six-time panelist at the ABA Antitrust Section’s Spring Meeting, the premier annual antitrust conference. He has also spoken to broader audiences in podcasts and at gatherings of in-house counsel. Multiple publications have highlighted Mark’s work and its impact, including The Antitrust Source, which published his co-authored article, “DraftKings/FanDuel: Adventures in Challenging a Merger Using an Effects-Driven Approach.” The FTC has repeatedly recognized Mark’s accomplishments and expertise and he is a four-time recipient of the agency’s Janet Steiger Team Award and a three-time recipient of the agency’s Award for Superior Service. In 2009, he was the recipient of the agency’s Director’s Award and in 2008, he received the agency’s Award for Meritorious Service.
Mark is an active member of the American Bar Association, Section of Antitrust Law and the American Health Law Association.

Nearly 100 health care leaders, state dignitaries and community members joined together today at Cabell Huntington Hospital for the unveiling of the newly named Robert and Lena Shell Outpatient Medical Pavilion. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the hospital’s main campus with a special dedication honoring the Shell family, a prominent Huntington family recognized for its significant commitment to Marshall Health Network.

Todd Shell, son of the late Robert "Bob" Shell, said Father’s Day weekend was the perfect time to make this announcement to honor his father's legacy. He added, "We are here today because of the love, dedication, hard work, long hours and absolute devotion to my dad’s health care. We are so grateful to the hospitals, the physicians and the staff of Marshall Health Network.”

By MetroNews Staff 
January 16, 2021 - 4:34 am
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Nurses and nurse practitioners at Cabell Huntington Hospital, a Mountain Health facility, have approved a new three-year contract.
Those with the Service Employees International Union District 1199, representing nearly 1,000 workers, announced the ratification early Saturday after two days of voting on Thursday and Friday at the Double Tree Hotel in Huntington.
“Nurses with Cabell Huntington Hospital stood united at the bargaining table and they were diligent in negotiating the details of this agreement,” said Joyce Gibson, SEIU 1199 secretary-treasurer, in a statement.
“The new agreement ensures that these vital nurses will have job security and a voice for the patients they serve and it will strengthen quality care, in addition to wages and benefits.”
The contract came out of negotiations throughout 2020 focused largely on health benefits and staffing issues.
Last fall, members of SEIU District 1199 authorized a bargaining committee to issue a ten-day strike notice, if necessary.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) – Union rank and file on Wednesday night voted to accept an offer from Cabell Huntington Hospital, marking an effective end to the nearly month-long strike.
SEIU District 1199 confirmed that members, who had been on strike since Nov. 3, accepted the deal offered by the hospital on Tuesday.
“Our members stood proudly in solidarity on the strike line and beat back concession after concession. These healthcare heroes deserve way more than what this hospital finally offered, but we are celebrating the victories that were won,” said Sherri McKinney, regional director for the union.
Cabell Huntington Hospital released the following statement Wednesday night, saying striking employees could start returning to work as early as Friday:
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, Chief Operating Officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
SEIU District 1199 provided the following information about the hospital’s offer:
- “CHH conceded to give everyone an annual 2 percent increase across the board and add another 2 percent onto the wage scale, plus increases in the shift differential.”
- “The hospital also withdrew all of their concessionary proposals including cuts in holiday pay as part of the bargaining process. The only exception to this was on healthcare. The final agreement ratified today gives employees premium free healthcare until January 1, 2023. Employees will then start to pay bi-weekly premiums anywhere from $22 per pay to $176 per pay. However, each employee will be able to get that premium reduced by 20%-55% by going through annual health assessment process and earning between $500 and $1,000 off their premiums. The healthcare plan ratified has reduced deductibles and overall, less prescription cost.”
- “The hospital’s final offer does dramatically reduce benefits for retirees by stealing Cabell Hospital healthcare from those 65 years and older and replacing it with a $250 stipend they can use to purchase a supplemental plan. As part of the bargaining process Tuesday, the hospital agreed to extend the prescription discounts to the retirees to help off-set the cost unpaid by Medicare.”
- “Those qualifying employees who are retired or will retire between the age of 62-65 years old will still be able to keep the Cabell Hospital insurance plan but will have to pay $125 per month starting April 1, 2021.”
Hospital service workers with SEIU District 1199 have been on strike since Nov. 3. Their top concern has been health care costs.
Cabell Huntington Hospital said for many years it has covered health care premiums at 100%. It’s now asking union members to contribute, on average, less than 5% of their families’ total health care costs. The hospital had said that premiums are affordable and workers are paid at the top of their market.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

January 16, 2021 - 4:34 am
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Nurses and nurse practitioners at Cabell Huntington Hospital, a Mountain Health facility, have approved a new three-year contract.
Those with the Service Employees International Union District 1199, representing nearly 1,000 workers, announced the ratification early Saturday after two days of voting on Thursday and Friday at the Double Tree Hotel in Huntington.
“Nurses with Cabell Huntington Hospital stood united at the bargaining table and they were diligent in negotiating the details of this agreement,” said Joyce Gibson, SEIU 1199 secretary-treasurer, in a statement.
“The new agreement ensures that these vital nurses will have job security and a voice for the patients they serve and it will strengthen quality care, in addition to wages and benefits.”
The contract came out of negotiations throughout 2020 focused largely on health benefits and staffing issues.
Last fall, members of SEIU District 1199 authorized a bargaining committee to issue a ten-day strike notice, if necessary.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) – Union rank and file on Wednesday night voted to accept an offer from Cabell Huntington Hospital, marking an effective end to the nearly month-long strike.
SEIU District 1199 confirmed that members, who had been on strike since Nov. 3, accepted the deal offered by the hospital on Tuesday.
“Our members stood proudly in solidarity on the strike line and beat back concession after concession. These healthcare heroes deserve way more than what this hospital finally offered, but we are celebrating the victories that were won,” said Sherri McKinney, regional director for the union.
Cabell Huntington Hospital released the following statement Wednesday night, saying striking employees could start returning to work as early as Friday:
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, Chief Operating Officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
SEIU District 1199 provided the following information about the hospital’s offer:
- “CHH conceded to give everyone an annual 2 percent increase across the board and add another 2 percent onto the wage scale, plus increases in the shift differential.”
- “The hospital also withdrew all of their concessionary proposals including cuts in holiday pay as part of the bargaining process. The only exception to this was on healthcare. The final agreement ratified today gives employees premium free healthcare until January 1, 2023. Employees will then start to pay bi-weekly premiums anywhere from $22 per pay to $176 per pay. However, each employee will be able to get that premium reduced by 20%-55% by going through annual health assessment process and earning between $500 and $1,000 off their premiums. The healthcare plan ratified has reduced deductibles and overall, less prescription cost.”
- “The hospital’s final offer does dramatically reduce benefits for retirees by stealing Cabell Hospital healthcare from those 65 years and older and replacing it with a $250 stipend they can use to purchase a supplemental plan. As part of the bargaining process Tuesday, the hospital agreed to extend the prescription discounts to the retirees to help off-set the cost unpaid by Medicare.”
- “Those qualifying employees who are retired or will retire between the age of 62-65 years old will still be able to keep the Cabell Hospital insurance plan but will have to pay $125 per month starting April 1, 2021.”
Hospital service workers with SEIU District 1199 have been on strike since Nov. 3. Their top concern has been health care costs.
Cabell Huntington Hospital said for many years it has covered health care premiums at 100%. It’s now asking union members to contribute, on average, less than 5% of their families’ total health care costs. The hospital had said that premiums are affordable and workers are paid at the top of their market.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

A West Virginia community continues to fight against opioid distributors with appeals court argument
Huntington and Cabell County got another day in court, when a federal appeals panel in Richmond, Va., heard oral arguments in their lawsuit over the flood of pills that devastated the community.

As West Virginia struggles with an addiction crisis that still claims more than 1,500 lives a year, one of the state’s hardest hit communities is continuing its legal fight to hold painkiller distributors responsible for the community-wide repercussions.
In July 2022 – after a lengthy and complex trial – Huntington and Cabell County lost a civil case that sought to make the nation’s three largest distributors fund efforts to provide more treatment, stem the deaths and rebuild from the disaster.
Lawyers for the community are appealing that decision and this week their case reached a major milestone when a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments.
David Frederick, a lawyer for Huntington and Cabell County, told the judges, “It was no accident that there is a massive addiction problem.”
Frederick walked the court through how the crisis unfolded: The distributors — AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — flooded the community with millions of highly addictive painkillers, with the shipments skyrocketing in a manner that federal drug laws required the companies to notice and investigate.
“This was happening month after month,” Frederick said. “The numbers went up and up and up.”
The companies should have foreseen the addiction epidemic, he said, since pharmacies kept ordering higher and higher quantities.
“When you look at the totality of the situation, 10% of the population of Huntington is addicted to opioids,” he said. “If oversupply wasn’t a contributor to that tragedy, I don’t know what causation means in the law.”

But Judge David A. Faber, in his 184-page-ruling, found that companies were only meeting doctor and pharmacy demand. Faber has also said that while doctors may have been overprescribing, there were other ways that could lead to oversupply that distributors couldn’t control, such as doctor shopping or theft from people with legitimate prescriptions.
Paul Schmidt, a lawyer for the companies, argued that the distributors hadn’t “influenced” doctors to prescribe more pain treatment pills and that Faber correctly found plaintiffs couldn’t offer a specific number of “correct” pill distributions.
“It was the good faith prescribing that accounted for the supply,” Schmidt said.
The three-judge panel hearing the case included Robert B. King, a West Virginia native appointed by President Bill Clinton, DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, appointed by President Joe Biden and Barbara Milano Keenan, appointed by President Barack Obama. 
Keenan asked about the numbers being “disproportionate.”
Schmidt said the court “made specific findings as to why West Virginia has higher prescribing rates for pain medication, it has a higher prevalence of health conditions that cause pain.” He added that “it has a job market that has a higher percentage, relatively speaking of jobs that are more likely to lead to pain, in terms of jobs that involve physical labor.”
Keenan and King pushed both sides on why they didn’t ask the West Virginia Supreme Court to weigh in on if public nuisance law was applicable. Faber ruled that it wasn’t, and lawyers for both sides told the appeals panel that move wasn’t necessary.
“The high court hasn’t given us any guidance,” King said. “There isn’t anything definitive and nobody has asked.”
King also asked why Cabell County and Huntington didn’t present their case to a jury, rather than having Faber decide it.

Defendants said it was the appropriate course of action for a public nuisance claim and that plaintiffs agreed.
Cabell and Huntington, with among the highest rates of overdose deaths in the country and an area known for drawing drug dealers, chose to go at it alone versus joining with dozens of other state municipalities in a combined lawsuit. State officials are now overseeing about $1 billion in settlement money from those cases.
Over eight years, 81 million opioid painkillers were delivered to Cabell County. The community’s attorneys wanted $2.5 billion for a plan addressing continuing impacts of the crisis by increasing prevention and treatment options, equipping first responders and getting people back to work and out of jails through drug courts and job training.
Faber ruled that this approach wasn’t actually doing anything about the alleged nuisance — the flood of painkillers — and therefore wasn’t an appropriate remedy in this sort of lawsuit. But the community’s lawyers argued that they weren’t seeking the money to pay for damages caused by the distributors, but money to fund future services aimed at improving current community conditions.
“These are treatments that are not about damages,” Frederick said. “It is about cure.”

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.

“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the Covid-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Claims by the City of Huntington and Cabell County Commission against the Big 3 opioid distributors in connection with the opioid epidemic remain alive following a decision from the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
U.S. District Judge David Faber
A 17-page order from the Court frames a certified question that it wants the West Virginia Supreme Court to answer in connection with what is a public nuisance under West Virginia law.

U.S. District Judge David Faber ruled in June 2022 that Huntington and Cabell County had failed to show, in a weeks long 2021 trial, that the dumping of millions of opioid pills in West Virginia by distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson was a public nuisance.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington,” Faber said. “And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law.”
The plaintiffs appealed Faber’s decision to the Fourth Circuit. It’s order, issued Monday, wants to know why Faber said the opioid case before him wasn’t a public nuisance under West Virginia law while similar cases filed by other cities and counties in state court (Mass Litigation Panel) did proceed under the public nuisance law.
Paul Farrell
The specific question from the appeals court:
“Under West Virginia’s common law, can conditions caused by the distribution of a controlled substance constitute a public nuisance and, if so, what are the elements of such a public nuisance claim?”
A negative answer from the High Court will stop the appeal. A positive one would send it back to the Fourth Circuit for further review of Faber’s original decision.
Huntington attorney Paul Farrell, representing the Cabell County Commission, said the Fourth Circuit sees a conflict.
“The Fourth Circuit ruled there is a conflict between how a federal court judge and how a West Virginia state court interpreted West Virginia law,” Farrell told MetroNews. “The Fourth Circuit asked the West Virginia Supreme Court to resolve the conflict.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling from the appeals court keeps the case alive. He said the Big 3 should be held responsible for their roles in the opioid epidemic.
“Commonsense would say they were creating a public nuisance and the fact that we have a chance to bring our arguments before the West Virginia State Supreme Court means everything,” Williams told MetroNews. “Hope is still alive in the state of West Virginia.”
Rusty Webb
Charleston attorney Rusty Webb, who has represented Huntington in the case, said the Fourth Circuit “did the right thing by putting it square before the West Virginia Supreme Court.”
Williams said the ruling keeps alive their hopes of receiving $2.5 billion in abatement funds from the distributors. The money would be used in a 15-eyar abatement plan.
“We’ve seen how many families have been affected and what has happened in the past but what we have to make sure that this never, ever happens again in our state,” Williams, a Democratic candidate for governor, said.
According to Faber’s June 2022 decision, most courts have rejected claims of public nuisance involving “the sale and distribution of a product.” The Supreme Court of Appeals for West Virginia has only applied the law in cases involving “conduct that interferes with public property or resources,” and West Virginia’s high court would likely decline to extend the law to situations related to opioid drugs.
Steve Williams
“The extension of the law of nuisance to cover the marketing and sale of opioids is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance,” he added. “The original legal character of nuisance was a wrongful disturbance of the enjoyment of real property or of its appurtenances falling short of a forcible trespass or ouster.”
But the Fourth Circuit order said the opioid cases argued before West Virginia’s Mass Litigation Panel has taken a different track.
“The West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel also has concluded in multiple instances that the distribution of opioids can form the basis of a public nuisance claim under West Virginia common law,” the Fourth Circuit order said.
Farrell said the Fourth Circuit’s ruling is just the next step in the case. He said there’s still potentially a long way to go with the appeal.
“Some say that the wheels of justice grind slowly but they grind nonetheless. This is but one step in the appeal process,” Farrell said.
Williams said Huntington knew it was in for the long haul when it first filed the lawsuit and the city won’t quit now.
“We have to hold onto our faith in our judicial system and by following through the process we will find justice for our citizens in the state,” Williams said.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.

Huntington, Cabell File Appeal Argument In Case Against Opioid Distributors

Share this Article
Following Cabell County and Huntington’s loss of their opioid lawsuit, the localities appealed that decision. Now the state supreme court is involved, and the city and the county have filed a 40-page brief with the court – asking it to see things their way. 
The localities didn’t lose for lack of evidence. They lost on a general disagreement on what qualifies as a “public nuisance.” The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia had a narrow interpretation of what constitutes a public nuisance. This differed from what both the plaintiffs and other courts have considered to be a public nuisance.  
When Huntington and Cabell appealed the case, the appellate court looked to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to answer this question: Can public nuisance laws be used to successfully sue drug distribution companies? 
Huntington and Cabell argued in their brief that the answer to that question is yes. And there is plenty of case law cited to support that, including a statewide opioid lawsuit that was won on a nearly identical premise and legal standard. The brief also lists other smaller lawsuits against energy and lumber companies that successfully used a public nuisance charge.
In a 1997 case against Kermit Lumber, a public nuisance legal standard was successfully used by the state of West Virginia. The court said in its decision that the term “public nuisance” does not have an exact definition, generally it has been described as the doing of, or failure to do something, that adversely affects the safety, health or morals of the public, or creates a substantial annoyance, inconvenience or injury to the public.  
“The federal district court opined that West Virginia law does not recognize a public nuisance claim based on the distribution of a controlled substance. Petitioners maintain that the district court erred in reaching that conclusion,” the brief said. 
Cabell and Huntington say that the more than 81 million dosage units that flooded a community of around 100,000 people, and the drug epidemic that ensued, is the responsibility of three drug manufacturers — McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. Those three companies supplied 89 percent of the Oxycontin that was sent to Cabell County. 
The localities say in the brief that the unreasonable opioid distribution practices that they say caused addiction, overdose deaths, infectious diseases, crime and decimated neighborhoods interfered with public health safety, property and resources. 
The brief also outlined the detrimental effect the epidemic had on babies and pregnant women in the state. 
“Thousands of babies — at times up to 10 percent of all newborns in Cabell/Huntington — have been born with neonatal abstinence syndrome due to pregnant mothers opioid use,” the brief said. 
The brief also lays out facts around the drug manufacturer’s failure to properly monitor the distribution of highly addictive substances, including multiple instances when federal regulators intervened with the companies warning them of lack of oversight in distribution and even taking punitive action. 
“In 2005, DEA met with respondents to convey the rising problem of opioid diversion and warned them that failing to maintain effective controls against diversion would create a crisis,” the brief said. 
It goes on to say that respondents did not take action to combat an influx of pills headed to small, rural areas like West Virginia, but instead took actions that incentivized employees of the drug distribution companies to continue the trend. 
“Respondents (Cardinal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen) used sales employees to conduct due diligence even though respondents compensated those workers based on how many opioids they sold,” the brief said. 
West Virginia Public Broadcasting has reached out to all three companies but did not hear back in time for publication. The three companies’ brief, which will argue why the narrow interpretation of a public nuisance by the fourth circuit court should be upheld, is scheduled to be filed May 20.

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

Cabell County to appeal judge’s ruling in opioid case
Cabell County to appeal being left out of opioid settlement(Keith Srakocic | AP)

CABELL COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) - A day after most West Virginia counties and cities learned they will receive $400 million in a settlement against the nation’s three largest opioid distributors, Cabell County -- the one county left out of the settlement -- filed notice to appeal a federal judge’s decision not to award any money to them or the city of Huntington in their suit against the big three.
Cabell County’s and Huntington’s case against Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health was heard by a federal judge last summer. Earlier this summer, the judge ruled in favor of the big three --not having a major role in the opioid epidemic in Cabell County.
The county’s case was among the first in the nation to be heard by a federal judge, considered a test trial, and they were not included in the lawsuit with the other West Virginia counties and cities.
However, Rusty Webb, an attorney who has the Huntington-Cabell County case and who also works with other cities and counties in the larger settlement, said Huntington and Cabell will be able to apply for money put in a public-private trust fund called “West Virginia First.”
Huntington and Cabell County can apply for funding from the trust which will include 72.5 percent from the $400 million settlement. They just will not be able to receive any of the 24.5 percent that’s guaranteed to cities and counties.
“Huntington and Cabell will still get monies from manufacturers that have been settled and pharmacies that have been settled and future pharmacies that have been settled. However, they won’t get any monies from the $400 million,” Webb said.
It’s not clear when Cabell County’s and Huntington’s case will be heard.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — The Cabell County Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to appeal a federal judge's decision that sided with three drug manufacturers in a landmark opioid trial. The commission now joins the city of Huntington in fighting the ruling made on July 4, but deciding to appeal is no guarantee the case will be heard again.
It took Cabell County commissioners one hour in executive session to decide to appeal their case. The city of Huntington decided to appeal a couple days ago. Commission President Jim Morgan believes the community has been wronged.
"We are determining the proper steps to take to prove that the distributors were indeed responsible, at least in part, for the opioid crisis we have in Cabell County," Morgan said.
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams believes the city has been targeted by drug distributors.
"I am even more determined to make blessed sure that we continue to look these folks in the eye and say, 'You did this to our community and you are going to pay,' " Williams said.
Huntington attorney Paul Farrell will continue to represent Huntington and Cabell County.
"We believe from a factual standpoint Judge Faber ruled that these distributors properly distributed prescriptions opioids into Huntington and Cabell County and did due diligence to clear them of suspicion," Farrell said.
During the trial, Farrell argued the opioid epidemic was a public nuisance. Over the period of eight years, opioid distributors flooded the community with more than 80 million pills.
Williams reports because of the court case, Huntington has an abatement plan regarding prescription opioids. He is hoping the drug companies will pay for it.
"This abatement plan gives us the opportunity to make sure this never, ever happens again in our community," Williams added.
The case was rendered on July 4, meaning the city and county have 30 days to appeal. The appeal will be sent to the Fourth Circuit Court in Richmond, Va., and it's possible the court could deny the appeal.

This is the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse in Charleston.
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Attorneys representing the city of Huntington and Cabell County say they plan to appeal a federal judge’s decision to side with three drug distributors in a landmark opioid trial.
The Cabell County Commission voted unanimously Thursday to fight the ruling made by U.S. District Judge David Faber on July 4.
Faber ruled in favor of AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. about a year after the trial ended at the federal courthouse in Charleston.
The judge said in his ruling that the distributors showed no proof of creating a public nuisance of fueling the opioid epidemic like the city and county claimed.
The attorneys said the judgment was wrong and there were factual errors. They were seeking $2.5 billion in damages to cover a 15 year plan to prevent further overdose deaths. Instead, the municipalities received nothing.
The lawsuit was heard during a three month long trial.
Faber’s decision is having an impact on a separate trial involving more than 60 cities and counties in Kanawha County. The trial was delayed a day after the judge’s ruling on July 5. A new trial date has not been set, but there are reports all sides have agreed to a possible $400 settlement with same Big 3 distributors.

As West Virginia struggles with an addiction crisis that still claims more than 1,500 lives a year, one of the state’s hardest hit communities is continuing its legal fight to hold painkiller distributors responsible for the community-wide repercussions.
In July 2022 – after a lengthy and complex trial – Huntington and Cabell County lost a civil case that sought to make the nation’s three largest distributors fund efforts to provide more treatment, stem the deaths and rebuild from the disaster.
Lawyers for the community are appealing that decision and this week their case reached a major milestone when a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments.
David Frederick, a lawyer for Huntington and Cabell County, told the judges, “It was no accident that there is a massive addiction problem.”
Frederick walked the court through how the crisis unfolded: The distributors — AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — flooded the community with millions of highly addictive painkillers, with the shipments skyrocketing in a manner that federal drug laws required the companies to notice and investigate.
“This was happening month after month,” Frederick said. “The numbers went up and up and up.”
The companies should have foreseen the addiction epidemic, he said, since pharmacies kept ordering higher and higher quantities.
“When you look at the totality of the situation, 10% of the population of Huntington is addicted to opioids,” he said. “If oversupply wasn’t a contributor to that tragedy, I don’t know what causation means in the law.”

But Judge David A. Faber, in his 184-page-ruling, found that companies were only meeting doctor and pharmacy demand. Faber has also said that while doctors may have been overprescribing, there were other ways that could lead to oversupply that distributors couldn’t control, such as doctor shopping or theft from people with legitimate prescriptions.
Paul Schmidt, a lawyer for the companies, argued that the distributors hadn’t “influenced” doctors to prescribe more pain treatment pills and that Faber correctly found plaintiffs couldn’t offer a specific number of “correct” pill distributions.
“It was the good faith prescribing that accounted for the supply,” Schmidt said.
The three-judge panel hearing the case included Robert B. King, a West Virginia native appointed by President Bill Clinton, DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, appointed by President Joe Biden and Barbara Milano Keenan, appointed by President Barack Obama. 
Keenan asked about the numbers being “disproportionate.”
Schmidt said the court “made specific findings as to why West Virginia has higher prescribing rates for pain medication, it has a higher prevalence of health conditions that cause pain.” He added that “it has a job market that has a higher percentage, relatively speaking of jobs that are more likely to lead to pain, in terms of jobs that involve physical labor.”
Keenan and King pushed both sides on why they didn’t ask the West Virginia Supreme Court to weigh in on if public nuisance law was applicable. Faber ruled that it wasn’t, and lawyers for both sides told the appeals panel that move wasn’t necessary.
“The high court hasn’t given us any guidance,” King said. “There isn’t anything definitive and nobody has asked.”
King also asked why Cabell County and Huntington didn’t present their case to a jury, rather than having Faber decide it.

Defendants said it was the appropriate course of action for a public nuisance claim and that plaintiffs agreed.
Cabell and Huntington, with among the highest rates of overdose deaths in the country and an area known for drawing drug dealers, chose to go at it alone versus joining with dozens of other state municipalities in a combined lawsuit. State officials are now overseeing about $1 billion in settlement money from those cases.
Over eight years, 81 million opioid painkillers were delivered to Cabell County. The community’s attorneys wanted $2.5 billion for a plan addressing continuing impacts of the crisis by increasing prevention and treatment options, equipping first responders and getting people back to work and out of jails through drug courts and job training.
Faber ruled that this approach wasn’t actually doing anything about the alleged nuisance — the flood of painkillers — and therefore wasn’t an appropriate remedy in this sort of lawsuit. But the community’s lawyers argued that they weren’t seeking the money to pay for damages caused by the distributors, but money to fund future services aimed at improving current community conditions.
“These are treatments that are not about damages,” Frederick said. “It is about cure.”

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.

“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the Covid-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Claims by the City of Huntington and Cabell County Commission against the Big 3 opioid distributors in connection with the opioid epidemic remain alive following a decision from the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
U.S. District Judge David Faber
A 17-page order from the Court frames a certified question that it wants the West Virginia Supreme Court to answer in connection with what is a public nuisance under West Virginia law.

U.S. District Judge David Faber ruled in June 2022 that Huntington and Cabell County had failed to show, in a weeks long 2021 trial, that the dumping of millions of opioid pills in West Virginia by distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson was a public nuisance.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington,” Faber said. “And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law.”
The plaintiffs appealed Faber’s decision to the Fourth Circuit. It’s order, issued Monday, wants to know why Faber said the opioid case before him wasn’t a public nuisance under West Virginia law while similar cases filed by other cities and counties in state court (Mass Litigation Panel) did proceed under the public nuisance law.
Paul Farrell
The specific question from the appeals court:
“Under West Virginia’s common law, can conditions caused by the distribution of a controlled substance constitute a public nuisance and, if so, what are the elements of such a public nuisance claim?”
A negative answer from the High Court will stop the appeal. A positive one would send it back to the Fourth Circuit for further review of Faber’s original decision.
Huntington attorney Paul Farrell, representing the Cabell County Commission, said the Fourth Circuit sees a conflict.
“The Fourth Circuit ruled there is a conflict between how a federal court judge and how a West Virginia state court interpreted West Virginia law,” Farrell told MetroNews. “The Fourth Circuit asked the West Virginia Supreme Court to resolve the conflict.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling from the appeals court keeps the case alive. He said the Big 3 should be held responsible for their roles in the opioid epidemic.
“Commonsense would say they were creating a public nuisance and the fact that we have a chance to bring our arguments before the West Virginia State Supreme Court means everything,” Williams told MetroNews. “Hope is still alive in the state of West Virginia.”
Rusty Webb
Charleston attorney Rusty Webb, who has represented Huntington in the case, said the Fourth Circuit “did the right thing by putting it square before the West Virginia Supreme Court.”
Williams said the ruling keeps alive their hopes of receiving $2.5 billion in abatement funds from the distributors. The money would be used in a 15-eyar abatement plan.
“We’ve seen how many families have been affected and what has happened in the past but what we have to make sure that this never, ever happens again in our state,” Williams, a Democratic candidate for governor, said.
According to Faber’s June 2022 decision, most courts have rejected claims of public nuisance involving “the sale and distribution of a product.” The Supreme Court of Appeals for West Virginia has only applied the law in cases involving “conduct that interferes with public property or resources,” and West Virginia’s high court would likely decline to extend the law to situations related to opioid drugs.
Steve Williams
“The extension of the law of nuisance to cover the marketing and sale of opioids is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance,” he added. “The original legal character of nuisance was a wrongful disturbance of the enjoyment of real property or of its appurtenances falling short of a forcible trespass or ouster.”
But the Fourth Circuit order said the opioid cases argued before West Virginia’s Mass Litigation Panel has taken a different track.
“The West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel also has concluded in multiple instances that the distribution of opioids can form the basis of a public nuisance claim under West Virginia common law,” the Fourth Circuit order said.
Farrell said the Fourth Circuit’s ruling is just the next step in the case. He said there’s still potentially a long way to go with the appeal.
“Some say that the wheels of justice grind slowly but they grind nonetheless. This is but one step in the appeal process,” Farrell said.
Williams said Huntington knew it was in for the long haul when it first filed the lawsuit and the city won’t quit now.
“We have to hold onto our faith in our judicial system and by following through the process we will find justice for our citizens in the state,” Williams said.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.

Huntington, Cabell File Appeal Argument In Case Against Opioid Distributors
Eric Douglas/West Virginia Public Broadcasting
Share this Article
Following Cabell County and Huntington’s loss of their opioid lawsuit, the localities appealed that decision. Now the state supreme court is involved, and the city and the county have filed a 40-page brief with the court – asking it to see things their way. 
The localities didn’t lose for lack of evidence. They lost on a general disagreement on what qualifies as a “public nuisance.” The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia had a narrow interpretation of what constitutes a public nuisance. This differed from what both the plaintiffs and other courts have considered to be a public nuisance.  
When Huntington and Cabell appealed the case, the appellate court looked to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to answer this question: Can public nuisance laws be used to successfully sue drug distribution companies? 
Huntington and Cabell argued in their brief that the answer to that question is yes. And there is plenty of case law cited to support that, including a statewide opioid lawsuit that was won on a nearly identical premise and legal standard. The brief also lists other smaller lawsuits against energy and lumber companies that successfully used a public nuisance charge.
In a 1997 case against Kermit Lumber, a public nuisance legal standard was successfully used by the state of West Virginia. The court said in its decision that the term “public nuisance” does not have an exact definition, generally it has been described as the doing of, or failure to do something, that adversely affects the safety, health or morals of the public, or creates a substantial annoyance, inconvenience or injury to the public.  
“The federal district court opined that West Virginia law does not recognize a public nuisance claim based on the distribution of a controlled substance. Petitioners maintain that the district court erred in reaching that conclusion,” the brief said. 
Cabell and Huntington say that the more than 81 million dosage units that flooded a community of around 100,000 people, and the drug epidemic that ensued, is the responsibility of three drug manufacturers — McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. Those three companies supplied 89 percent of the Oxycontin that was sent to Cabell County. 
The localities say in the brief that the unreasonable opioid distribution practices that they say caused addiction, overdose deaths, infectious diseases, crime and decimated neighborhoods interfered with public health safety, property and resources. 
The brief also outlined the detrimental effect the epidemic had on babies and pregnant women in the state. 
“Thousands of babies — at times up to 10 percent of all newborns in Cabell/Huntington — have been born with neonatal abstinence syndrome due to pregnant mothers opioid use,” the brief said. 
The brief also lays out facts around the drug manufacturer’s failure to properly monitor the distribution of highly addictive substances, including multiple instances when federal regulators intervened with the companies warning them of lack of oversight in distribution and even taking punitive action. 
“In 2005, DEA met with respondents to convey the rising problem of opioid diversion and warned them that failing to maintain effective controls against diversion would create a crisis,” the brief said. 
It goes on to say that respondents did not take action to combat an influx of pills headed to small, rural areas like West Virginia, but instead took actions that incentivized employees of the drug distribution companies to continue the trend. 
“Respondents (Cardinal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen) used sales employees to conduct due diligence even though respondents compensated those workers based on how many opioids they sold,” the brief said. 
West Virginia Public Broadcasting has reached out to all three companies but did not hear back in time for publication. The three companies’ brief, which will argue why the narrow interpretation of a public nuisance by the fourth circuit court should be upheld, is scheduled to be filed May 20.

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

Cabell County to appeal judge’s ruling in opioid case
Cabell County to appeal being left out of opioid settlement(Keith Srakocic | AP)

CABELL COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) - A day after most West Virginia counties and cities learned they will receive $400 million in a settlement against the nation’s three largest opioid distributors, Cabell County -- the one county left out of the settlement -- filed notice to appeal a federal judge’s decision not to award any money to them or the city of Huntington in their suit against the big three.
Cabell County’s and Huntington’s case against Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health was heard by a federal judge last summer. Earlier this summer, the judge ruled in favor of the big three --not having a major role in the opioid epidemic in Cabell County.
The county’s case was among the first in the nation to be heard by a federal judge, considered a test trial, and they were not included in the lawsuit with the other West Virginia counties and cities.
However, Rusty Webb, an attorney who has the Huntington-Cabell County case and who also works with other cities and counties in the larger settlement, said Huntington and Cabell will be able to apply for money put in a public-private trust fund called “West Virginia First.”
Huntington and Cabell County can apply for funding from the trust which will include 72.5 percent from the $400 million settlement. They just will not be able to receive any of the 24.5 percent that’s guaranteed to cities and counties.
“Huntington and Cabell will still get monies from manufacturers that have been settled and pharmacies that have been settled and future pharmacies that have been settled. However, they won’t get any monies from the $400 million,” Webb said.
It’s not clear when Cabell County’s and Huntington’s case will be heard.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — The Cabell County Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to appeal a federal judge's decision that sided with three drug manufacturers in a landmark opioid trial. The commission now joins the city of Huntington in fighting the ruling made on July 4, but deciding to appeal is no guarantee the case will be heard again.
It took Cabell County commissioners one hour in executive session to decide to appeal their case. The city of Huntington decided to appeal a couple days ago. Commission President Jim Morgan believes the community has been wronged.
"We are determining the proper steps to take to prove that the distributors were indeed responsible, at least in part, for the opioid crisis we have in Cabell County," Morgan said.
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams believes the city has been targeted by drug distributors.
"I am even more determined to make blessed sure that we continue to look these folks in the eye and say, 'You did this to our community and you are going to pay,' " Williams said.
Huntington attorney Paul Farrell will continue to represent Huntington and Cabell County.
"We believe from a factual standpoint Judge Faber ruled that these distributors properly distributed prescriptions opioids into Huntington and Cabell County and did due diligence to clear them of suspicion," Farrell said.
During the trial, Farrell argued the opioid epidemic was a public nuisance. Over the period of eight years, opioid distributors flooded the community with more than 80 million pills.
Williams reports because of the court case, Huntington has an abatement plan regarding prescription opioids. He is hoping the drug companies will pay for it.
"This abatement plan gives us the opportunity to make sure this never, ever happens again in our community," Williams added.
The case was rendered on July 4, meaning the city and county have 30 days to appeal. The appeal will be sent to the Fourth Circuit Court in Richmond, Va., and it's possible the court could deny the appeal.

This is the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse in Charleston.
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Attorneys representing the city of Huntington and Cabell County say they plan to appeal a federal judge’s decision to side with three drug distributors in a landmark opioid trial.
The Cabell County Commission voted unanimously Thursday to fight the ruling made by U.S. District Judge David Faber on July 4.
Faber ruled in favor of AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. about a year after the trial ended at the federal courthouse in Charleston.
The judge said in his ruling that the distributors showed no proof of creating a public nuisance of fueling the opioid epidemic like the city and county claimed.
The attorneys said the judgment was wrong and there were factual errors. They were seeking $2.5 billion in damages to cover a 15 year plan to prevent further overdose deaths. Instead, the municipalities received nothing.
The lawsuit was heard during a three month long trial.
Faber’s decision is having an impact on a separate trial involving more than 60 cities and counties in Kanawha County. The trial was delayed a day after the judge’s ruling on July 5. A new trial date has not been set, but there are reports all sides have agreed to a possible $400 settlement with same Big 3 distributors.

Susan: To gather comprehensive and detailed information on Cabell Huntington Hospital, we can break down our research strategy into several targeted areas. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Financial Information
- **Annual Reports and Financial Statements**: Look for publicly available annual reports and financial statements. These can often be found on the hospital’s official website under an ‘Investors’ or ‘About Us’ section. Websites like Guidestar or ProPublica may also have financial data if the hospital is a non-profit.
- **Charity Navigator and Hospital Compare**: These can provide financial health metrics and quality ratings.
- **Local Business Journals**: Check the Huntington Business Journal or similar publications for financial news and performance reports.

### 2. Key Decision Makers
- **Executive Leadership**: Identify the CEO, CFO, COO, Board of Directors, and other key executives. This information is often found on the hospital’s website under a ‘Leadership’ or ‘About Us’ section.
- **LinkedIn**: Use LinkedIn to research the professional backgrounds of the key leaders.
- **Press Releases**: Read recent press releases for mentions of key decision-makers and any changes in leadership.

### 3. Labor Relations
- **Current and Past Labor Agreements**: Search for existing union contracts or any past labor disputes. Resources like the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) website can be informative.
- **News Articles**: Use Google News to search for any recent articles about labor issues, strikes, or negotiations at Cabell Huntington Hospital.

### 4. Recent Scandals
- **Local News Outlets**: Look up news articles from local newspapers such as The Herald-Dispatch for any reports on scandals or controversies.
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Check the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General or the state’s health department for any reports or sanctions.
- **Court Records**: Search for any ongoing or past litigation involving the hospital.

### 5. Other Points of Leverage
- **Community Impact**: Research the hospital’s involvement in the local community. Partnerships, sponsorships, and community outreach can serve as points of leverage.
- **Patient Reviews and Ratings**: Check websites like Healthgrades, Yelp, and Google Reviews for patient feedback.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Identify other hospitals in the region and compare services, financial health, and labor practices.

### Action Plan

1. **Visit the official website of Cabell Huntington Hospital**
   - Look for annual reports, leadership information, and press releases.
2. **Financial Databases and Websites**
   - Access Guidestar, ProPublica, Charity Navigator, and local business journals for financial data.
3. **LinkedIn and Professional Networks**
   - Collect details of the executive leadership team and board members.
4. **Google News and Local News Websites**
   - Use search terms like “Cabell Huntington Hospital labor relations,” “Cabell Huntington Hospital scandal,” and “Cabell Huntington Hospital executive team.”
5. **Regulatory and Judicial Databases**
   - Check for any health department reports, lawsuit records, and NLRB filings.
6. **Review Platforms**
   - Compile patient reviews from Healthgrades, Yelp, and Google Reviews.
7. **Community and Competitor Information**
   - Investigate the hospital’s community outreach programs and compare with local competitors.

By following this comprehensive strategy, we should be able to compile a detailed and actionable research brief on Cabell Huntington Hospital.
Manny: Great strategy, Susan! To ensure we have all aspects covered and can execute effectively, I have a few follow-up questions:

### Financial Information
1. How frequently should we check the sources for financial information to ensure we are capturing the most current data?
2. Do you have specific contact persons or departments at Cabell Huntington Hospital we can reach out to for additional financial information if it’s not publicly available?

### Key Decision Makers
3. Do we have existing profiles, templates, or guidelines for documenting information on key decision-makers?
4. Are we prioritizing specific decision-makers or board members based on their influence over labor relations and financial decisions?

### Labor Relations
5. Are there specific unions we should focus on when looking for current and past labor agreements?
6. Should we also look into employee review websites like Glassdoor or Indeed for insights on internal labor relations?

### Recent Scandals
7. How far back should we search for news articles and reports on scandals?
8. Would you recommend setting up Google Alerts for ongoing monitoring of scandals and other notable news?

### Other Points of Leverage
9. How should we quantify or categorize the hospital’s community impact for our report?
10. Are there specific metrics or criteria we should use when comparing Cabell Huntington Hospital to its competitors?

### Action Plan Execution
11. What timeline are we working with for compiling this research? Are there any interim deadlines?
12. Should we divide the areas of focus among team members, or will we all contribute to each section?

Understanding these details will help us streamline the research process and ensure thorough and accurate reporting. Let me know your thoughts.
Susan: Great follow-up questions, Manny! I’m glad to see you’re thinking through these critical aspects. Here are my responses to each of your questions:

### Financial Information
1. **Frequency of Check-ins**: Ideally, we should check the financial sources quarterly to align with common reporting periods. However, keeping a monthly check on news sources can help us stay updated on any significant financial changes or announcements.
2. **Contact Persons**: If additional information isn't publicly available, we may reach out to the hospital’s Public Relations or Investor Relations departments. I’ll help draft a standardized email request template to streamline our inquiries.

### Key Decision Makers
3. **Documentation Templates**: Yes, we do have existing templates for capturing detailed profiles on key decision-makers. I will share these templates with the team.
4. **Prioritization of Decision-Makers**: Let's prioritize the CEO, CFO, and any upper management directly involved with labor relations first. Understanding their influence on financial and labor decisions is crucial.

### Labor Relations
5. **Focus on Specific Unions**: We should focus on unions that represent healthcare workers, such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). We can look into the specific locals that have dealings with the hospital.
6. **Employee Review Websites**: Yes, looking into Glassdoor and Indeed for employee feedback is a good idea. This can give us an internal perspective on labor relations and working conditions.

### Recent Scandals
7. **Time Frame for Searching Scandals**: Let’s look back at least five years for any significant scandals or controversies. This will provide a thorough historical context.
8. **Google Alerts**: Definitely, setting up Google Alerts for consistent monitoring is a smart move. We can use specific keywords such as “Cabell Huntington Hospital scandal” or “Cabell Huntington Hospital lawsuit.”

### Other Points of Leverage
9. **Quantifying Community Impact**: We can quantify community impact by categorizing their activities into healthcare services, charitable contributions, community health initiatives, and partnerships. Data points can include the number of community programs, funds allocated, and direct feedback from community members.
10. **Metrics for Competitor Comparison**: Let’s use metrics such as patient satisfaction scores, financial health indicators, labor relations histories, and community involvement activities to compare competitors effectively.

### Action Plan Execution
11. **Timeline and Deadlines**: Let's aim to gather all necessary information within the next six weeks, with interim deadlines every two weeks to review our progress. This allows time for verification and any follow-up needed.
12. **Division of Focus Areas**: I recommend we divide the areas of focus among team members to ensure thorough coverage. Each team member can specialize in one or two areas, and we’ll have regular check-ins to synthesize the information.

I believe this should help us produce a detailed and actionable research brief on Cabell Huntington Hospital. Let’s touch base in our next team meeting to assign specific tasks and finalize the timeline.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT RECOGNIZES MOUNTAIN HEALTH HOSPITALS IN ANNUAL RATINGS
U.S. News & World Report recognizes Mountain Health hospitals in annual ratings
Tuesday, August 1, 2023
St. Mary’s Medical Center named among Best Hospitals
St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC) and Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), members of Mountain Health Network (MHN), have been recognized in the annual U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals rankings and ratings for 2023-24. The rankings and ratings assist patients and their doctors in choosing the right hospital for them.
SMMC has been recognized among the elite 12% evaluated that earned a Best Hospitals ranking. Hospitals awarded a “Best” designation excelled at factors, such as clinical outcomes, level of nursing care and patient experience. This is the sixth consecutive year SMMC has been recognized as a Best Hospital.
SMMC has also been recognized as a High Performing Hospital for back surgery (spinal fusion), COPD, colon cancer surgery, heart attack, heart bypass surgery, heart failure, hip replacement, pneumonia and stroke. CHH has been recognized as a High Performing Hospital for COPD, knee replacement and stroke.
High performing is the highest distinction a hospital can earn for U.S. News’ Best Hospitals Procedures & Conditions ratings. Fewer than half of evaluated hospitals earned any High Performing rating.
“Our physicians and staff have a strong commitment to the health and well-being of the people of our region,” said Hoyt Burdick, MD, chief medical officer, MHN. “We are extremely pleased that commitment has been recognized by such a prestigious organization.”
U.S. News evaluated more than 4,500 hospitals across 15 specialties and 21 procedures and conditions.
“For 34 years, U.S. News has provided data-informed rankings to help patients and their doctors find the best hospital to treat their illness or condition,” said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

High performing is the highest distinction a hospital can earn for U.S. News’ Best Hospitals Procedures & Conditions ratings. Fewer than half of evaluated hospitals earned any High Performing rating.
“Our physicians and staff have a strong commitment to the health and well-being of the people of our region,” said Hoyt Burdick, MD, chief medical officer, MHN. “We are extremely pleased that commitment has been recognized by such a prestigious organization.”
U.S. News evaluated more than 4,500 hospitals across 15 specialties and 21 procedures and conditions.
“For 34 years, U.S. News has provided data-informed rankings to help patients and their doctors find the best hospital to treat their illness or condition,” said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and full Form 990 documents, in both PDF and digital formats.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2019 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2018 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs and digital copies of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of separate releases by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency, which we update regularly.
We also link to copies of audits nonprofit organizations that spent $750,000 or more in Federal grant money in a single fiscal year since 2016. These audits are copied from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

The strike began Nov. 3. (Photo SEIU 1199/Facebook)
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

Cabell Huntington Hospital employees threaten to strike over pay, benefits

October 21, 2021 - 12:27 pm
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Nearly 1,000 union workers in the service and maintenance units at Cabell Huntington Hospital are set to go on strike if a contract deal isn’t reached by Nov. 2.
Service Employees International Union District 1199, which represents lab and X-ray technicians, as well as cleaning staff within those units, voted Wednesday to send a 10-day strike notice to hospital management.
The union is seeking wage increases, quality care, safe staffing and continued health insurance coverage.
“There are concessions around holiday times, wages and health insurance, even around non-economic issues that don’t cost them anything. This isn’t the year or the contract for that,” said Sherri McKinney, regional director with SEIU District 1199.
McKinney told MetroNews on Thursday the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on hospital workers and that they deserve to maintain job security while risking their lives every day.
“They risk getting COVID themselves and taking it home to their families and loved ones. They’re just not going to take it,” she said.
Service and maintenance staff play a key role in helping the rest of the hospital run smoothly, McKinney said.
“It’s people that work with those nurses day in and day out in a pandemic trying to keep the doors open and keep the place clean. They (the hospital) want to make all their money off the backs of them and we’re not going to have that happen,” she said.
SEIU 1199 has negotiated with Cabell Huntington Hospital since 1975.
McKinney said the last strike was in 1998.
The hospital has had its ups and downs financially over the years, but McKinney said they’re not currently hurting for money especially with federal pandemic relief funds rolling in.
“We’ve bargained with this hospital when they weren’t making money and workers chose to take wage freezes, but that’s not the case. They’re making record profits,” she said.
The union was required to notify the hospital of a potential strike. According to the National Labor Relations Act, labor organizations have to give health care institutions at least 10 days’ notice prior to walking off the job.
As of Thursday afternoon, Cabell Huntington Hospital did not immediately respond to MetroNews’ request for comment.
Both sides return to the bargaining table Tuesday and Wednesday.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is one of the largest employers in Huntington.

THE MATERNITY CENTER
LABOR & DELIVERY
Labor & Delivery
The Maternity Center at Cabell Huntington Hospital offers high-quality maternity care, which is why we've been designated as "Birthing-Friendly" by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a designated "Birthing-Friendly" hospital.
Mothers deliver their babies in large, light-filled private birthing rooms in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Suite, which is on the third floor of the North Patient Tower directly above the Emergency Room. The rooms were designed with the mother's care and comfort in mind, from natural birth to high-risk deliveries we want your birth experience to be everything you intend.
Cesarean Sections & Emergencies
If a Cesarean section (C-section) is planned, or in case of emergency, there are two specialized surgical suites within the unit and an infant stabilization room to provide care for babies who are premature or experiencing medical problems.
Visitation
For the safety of our mothers and babies, Labor & Delivery is a locked unit. Visitors will enter through the door at the front of the unit and each visitor will receive a yellow wristband for their visit. Four designated visitors may accompany the patient for the entirety of their stay. One of these designated visitors may spend the night from 8 p.m. – 8 a.m. For the comfort of our mothers, we ask that no food be brought into the unit without checking with the nurse first. Siblings of the new baby are invited to visit between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. when accompanied by an adult and are not counted as visitors.
What to Bring
The Labor and Delivery Unit will provide diapers, wipes and diaper ointment as well as hospital T-shirts with hand covers, blankets and burp clothes. For mothers who choose to formula feed, we provide the formula. Mothers are permitted to dress infants in their personal clothes, but the hospital will not be responsible if those get misplaced. For moms,hospital gowns and disposable underwear are available and highly recommended due to bleeding after delivery. If soiled, they can just be thrown away. Of course, some moms are comfortable in their own clothes. We have hospital personal hygiene products, but again, some moms prefer to bring their own.
Delivery
Four designated visitors are welcome during the delivery. Physical contact is important for every new baby and breastfeeding keeps mother and baby close. Whether you choose to breastfeed or not we support the natural process of bonding through skin to skin contact.
Once you have delivered and recovered, you will be moved to the Mother Baby Unit where you will remain until discharge. On mother baby you may have any two visitors at the bedside during hospital visiting hours in addition to your support person. The support person may spend the night. Siblings are also invited to visit Mother Baby during visiting hours. The current visitation guidelines can be viewed under “Patients & Visitors.”
When time is of the essence, Cabell Huntington Hospital has an experienced maternal transport team that is specially trained to care for pregnant women or mothers who have just given birth while they are transported to the hospital by air or ground.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

Cabell Huntington Hospital workers end strike after reaching contract deal

The strike began Nov. 3. (Photo SEIU 1199/Facebook)
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A contract agreement has been reached among Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, ending a nearly month-long strike.
Members of SEIU District 1199 voted Wednesday to accept a three year contract that covers more than 900 workers including patient care assistants, technicians, clerks, aids, housekeepers, food service, LPNs and maintenance staff.
The hospital said in a statement striking employees could return to work as early as Friday.
“We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said Tim Martin, chief operating officer for Cabell Huntington Hospital. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”
MetroNews has reached out to SEIU 1199 Regional Director Sherri McKinney for comment.
“I commend the negotiating team in reaching a mutually beneficial contract,” stated Kevin Yingling, MD, Mountain Health Network CEO and President of CHH. “Throughout the negotiation process, I have been truly impressed by the expertise, experience, and guidance of our team. They have bargained earnestly and honestly to achieve a fair and equitable contract. I am deeply grateful for all that they have accomplished and look forward to continuing a shared focus on patients and caring for our community.”
The two parties were brought back by a federal mediator this week to resume negotiations. A temporary restraining order was put in place by a Cabell County judge during the strike to calm activity on the picket line. Temporary workers were brought in during the work stoppage.
The union was on strike in hopes of sending a message for better wages, continued health insurance and safe staffing.
The new contract took effect Dec. 1, 2021 and will run through Nov. 15, 2024.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Nearly 1,000 union workers in the service and maintenance units at Cabell Huntington Hospital are set to go on strike if a contract deal isn’t reached by Nov. 2.
Service Employees International Union District 1199, which represents lab and X-ray technicians, as well as cleaning staff within those units, voted Wednesday to send a 10-day strike notice to hospital management.
The union is seeking wage increases, quality care, safe staffing and continued health insurance coverage.
“There are concessions around holiday times, wages and health insurance, even around non-economic issues that don’t cost them anything. This isn’t the year or the contract for that,” said Sherri McKinney, regional director with SEIU District 1199.
McKinney told MetroNews on Thursday the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on hospital workers and that they deserve to maintain job security while risking their lives every day.
“They risk getting COVID themselves and taking it home to their families and loved ones. They’re just not going to take it,” she said.
Service and maintenance staff play a key role in helping the rest of the hospital run smoothly, McKinney said.
“It’s people that work with those nurses day in and day out in a pandemic trying to keep the doors open and keep the place clean. They (the hospital) want to make all their money off the backs of them and we’re not going to have that happen,” she said.
SEIU 1199 has negotiated with Cabell Huntington Hospital since 1975.
McKinney said the last strike was in 1998.
The hospital has had its ups and downs financially over the years, but McKinney said they’re not currently hurting for money especially with federal pandemic relief funds rolling in.
“We’ve bargained with this hospital when they weren’t making money and workers chose to take wage freezes, but that’s not the case. They’re making record profits,” she said.
The union was required to notify the hospital of a potential strike. According to the National Labor Relations Act, labor organizations have to give health care institutions at least 10 days’ notice prior to walking off the job.
As of Thursday afternoon, Cabell Huntington Hospital did not immediately respond to MetroNews’ request for comment.
Both sides return to the bargaining table Tuesday and Wednesday.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is one of the largest employers in Huntington.

THE MATERNITY CENTER
LABOR & DELIVERY
Labor & Delivery
The Maternity Center at Cabell Huntington Hospital offers high-quality maternity care, which is why we've been designated as "Birthing-Friendly" by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a designated "Birthing-Friendly" hospital.
Mothers deliver their babies in large, light-filled private birthing rooms in the Labor/Delivery/Recovery Suite, which is on the third floor of the North Patient Tower directly above the Emergency Room. The rooms were designed with the mother's care and comfort in mind, from natural birth to high-risk deliveries we want your birth experience to be everything you intend.
Cesarean Sections & Emergencies
If a Cesarean section (C-section) is planned, or in case of emergency, there are two specialized surgical suites within the unit and an infant stabilization room to provide care for babies who are premature or experiencing medical problems.
Visitation
For the safety of our mothers and babies, Labor & Delivery is a locked unit. Visitors will enter through the door at the front of the unit and each visitor will receive a yellow wristband for their visit. Four designated visitors may accompany the patient for the entirety of their stay. One of these designated visitors may spend the night from 8 p.m. – 8 a.m. For the comfort of our mothers, we ask that no food be brought into the unit without checking with the nurse first. Siblings of the new baby are invited to visit between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. when accompanied by an adult and are not counted as visitors.
What to Bring
The Labor and Delivery Unit will provide diapers, wipes and diaper ointment as well as hospital T-shirts with hand covers, blankets and burp clothes. For mothers who choose to formula feed, we provide the formula. Mothers are permitted to dress infants in their personal clothes, but the hospital will not be responsible if those get misplaced. For moms,hospital gowns and disposable underwear are available and highly recommended due to bleeding after delivery. If soiled, they can just be thrown away. Of course, some moms are comfortable in their own clothes. We have hospital personal hygiene products, but again, some moms prefer to bring their own.
Delivery
Four designated visitors are welcome during the delivery. Physical contact is important for every new baby and breastfeeding keeps mother and baby close. Whether you choose to breastfeed or not we support the natural process of bonding through skin to skin contact.
Once you have delivered and recovered, you will be moved to the Mother Baby Unit where you will remain until discharge. On mother baby you may have any two visitors at the bedside during hospital visiting hours in addition to your support person. The support person may spend the night. Siblings are also invited to visit Mother Baby during visiting hours. The current visitation guidelines can be viewed under “Patients & Visitors.”
When time is of the essence, Cabell Huntington Hospital has an experienced maternal transport team that is specially trained to care for pregnant women or mothers who have just given birth while they are transported to the hospital by air or ground.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

Cabell Huntington (W.Va.) Hospital President and CEO Kevin N. Fowler said the Huntington area will experience significant growth within the next five to 10 years, allowing the system to become a top healthcare provider and provide the types of services available in larger urban cities like Cincinnati or Pittsburgh, according to The State Journal.
Mr. Fowler told the publication the ever-changing hospital landscape has motivated numerous health systems nationwide to band together and "work … with hospitals they competed against in the past. Fortunately, here in Huntington, we have two entities that recognize the value of coming together, and I think that is going to be key to going forward."

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS NAMES TOP EXECUTIVES
Hospital’s COO Kevin Fowler becomes 8th President/CEO in CHH History and CFO Monte Ward assumes Chief Acquisition Officer Role
HUNTINGTON, WV – The Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. Board of Directors has named Kevin N. Fowler as President and CEO, and David Monte Ward Chief Acquisition Officer at its January 27, 2015 meeting. This announcement follows the retirement of Brent Marsteller on Jan. 1, 2015.
Mr. Fowler has served as the hospital’s senior vice president and chief operating officer (COO) since January 2014 after joining Cabell Huntington Hospital as the Vice President of Clinical Services in October 2013. He has more than 23 years of healthcare experience including serving as the CEO for EASTAR Health System in Oklahoma and the CEO for Logan Regional Medical Center in West Virginia.
Fowler earned his Bachelor’s degree from State University of New York (SUNY) in Plattsburgh, New York, and his Master’s degree in educational administration from Memphis State University in Tennessee. Fowler was a Naval Flight Officer for 11 years prior to his healthcare career.
“It is an honor to serve in this role for Cabell Huntington Hospital employees, physicians and our community,” Fowler said. “The work of Brent Marsteller will have a lasting impact on all we do, and I am eager to continue the mission of this organization that has served our region for nearly 60 years. On behalf of the entire hospital, we look forward to providing our patients with compassionate, quality care for many years to come.”
Mr. Ward has been the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with Cabell Huntington Hospital for more than 33 years. A lifelong resident of the area, he will continue as CFO and has accepted the additional role of Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) to lead the hospital through the acquisition process with St. Mary’s Medical Center.
"It has been very rewarding to have a front-row seat over the years as Cabell Huntington Hospital has become a major provider of key services to our community," Ward said. "I look forward to stepping into the role of CAO as we face the challenges of the future."
During Marsteller’s 14-year presidency, Cabell Huntington Hospital experienced unprecedented growth. During his tenure the hospital added the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, Hoops Family Children’s Hospital, an $85 million North Patient Tower and multiple other projects to the still-growing campus. Fowler and Ward will continue these projects through completion as well as help Cabell Huntington Hospital, Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and Marshall Health prepare for the future of medicine.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a 303-bed academic medical center located in Huntington, West Virginia. Cabell Huntington is home to the Hoops Family Children’s Hospital and the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center and cares for patients from more than 29 counties throughout West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is affiliated with Marshall University Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy and Nursing.

Cabell Huntington (W.Va.) Hospital President and CEO Kevin N. Fowler said the Huntington area will experience significant growth within the next five to 10 years, allowing the system to become a top healthcare provider and provide the types of services available in larger urban cities like Cincinnati or Pittsburgh, according to The State Journal.
Mr. Fowler told the publication the ever-changing hospital landscape has motivated numerous health systems nationwide to band together and "work … with hospitals they competed against in the past. Fortunately, here in Huntington, we have two entities that recognize the value of coming together, and I think that is going to be key to going forward."

Mr. Ward has been the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with Cabell Huntington Hospital for more than 33 years. A lifelong resident of the area, he will continue as CFO and has accepted the additional role of Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) to lead the hospital through the acquisition process with St. Mary’s Medical Center.
"It has been very rewarding to have a front-row seat over the years as Cabell Huntington Hospital has become a major provider of key services to our community," Ward said. "I look forward to stepping into the role of CAO as we face the challenges of the future."
During Marsteller’s 14-year presidency, Cabell Huntington Hospital experienced unprecedented growth. During his tenure the hospital added the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, Hoops Family Children’s Hospital, an $85 million North Patient Tower and multiple other projects to the still-growing campus. Fowler and Ward will continue these projects through completion as well as help Cabell Huntington Hospital, Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and Marshall Health prepare for the future of medicine.
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a 303-bed academic medical center located in Huntington, West Virginia. Cabell Huntington is home to the Hoops Family Children’s Hospital and the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center and cares for patients from more than 29 counties throughout West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is affiliated with Marshall University Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy and Nursing.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

Longtime workers allegedly promised lifetime health coverage
Settlement covers 210 non-union retirees
Retirees of West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. received final approval for a $5.6 million class settlement in their federal lawsuit challenging proposed cuts to their health coverage.
The deal provides payments of nearly $19,000 to each of 210 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be curtailed or terminated. It also creates a $500,000 “high risk fund” to help cover certain prescription drug costs not otherwise covered by a retiree’s Medicare Part D plan, and it allows the three class representatives to receive service awards of $15,000 each.

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

Two retired hospital workers filed a federal lawsuit accusing West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital of terminating retiree health coverage after repeatedly telling non-union workers they would receive lifetime coverage if they stayed with the company for at least 17 years.
The proposed class action, docketed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, challenges Cabell Huntington’s plans to terminate welfare benefits for non-union retirees in September. Plaintiffs Martha Blenko and Laura Mullarky say the company repeatedly informed them both verbally and in writing that these benefits would continue for the remainder of their lifetimes, which ...

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”

Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.

KENNY KEMP/CHARLESTON GAZETTE-MAIL VIA AP, FILE
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.

In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

Cabell Huntington Hospital 1 of 55 Hospitals in the US Penalized by Medicare 8 Years Straight Over Patient Complications
Published 1 year ago on June 17, 2023
By Staff Writer
Out of more than 6000 hospitals in the United States, Cabell Huntington joins 54 others on Medicare’s penalty list for 8 consecutive years. The Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program cuts payments by 1 percent for hospitals that fall in the worst-performing 25% in the country. More than 2,000 hospitals have been penalized at least once in the eight years since the program began. Fifty-five hospitals have penalized all eight years according to Kaiser Health News.
The program evaluates several quality measures including rates of infections, blood clots, and other complications that occur in hospitals and might have been prevented. Research conducted by Kaiser Health News have found little evidence that the penalties are getting hospitals to improve their efforts to avert bedsores, falls, infections and other accidents.
“Unfortunately, pretty much in every regard, the program has been a failure,” Andrew Ryan, a professor of health care management at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News. ”
One reason for low healthcare quality scores in West Virginia hospitals could be that all hospitals in the state are protected legislatively by Certificate of Need (CON). The original hope was that CON would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities. It is now widely accepted and documented by organizations like the National Institute for Health that Certificate of Need laws have instead limited access, degraded quality, and increased cost.
Other national programs measure hospital safety. Once such a program is conducted by Leapfrog. Thousands of hospitals nationwide report to the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to help patients and purchasers make better healthcare decisions. Cabell Huntington did not participate. Leapfrog does still measure other quality measures of the hospital. Cabell Huntington performs worse than average in several outcomes including “Death from serious treatable complications after surgery.” The link to the entire report can be found here.
The Affordable Care Act also penalizes hospitals for patient readmissions. Many West Virginia hospitals including Cabell Huntington are penalized for these outcomes as well. Princeton Community Hospital received the highest percentage of re-admission penalties in West Virginia with a 2.88% penalty in 2023. (Down from 3.0% in 2022).
Below is a table showing hospitals across the state that were penalized under the Medicare Hospital Acquired Conditions Reductions Program for the last three years.

HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

West Virginia Hospital Retirees Cleared for $5.6 Million Deal
Jacklyn Wille
Legal Reporter
Longtime workers allegedly promised lifetime health coverage
Settlement covers 210 non-union retirees
Retirees of West Virginia’s Cabell Huntington Hospital Inc. received final approval for a $5.6 million class settlement in their federal lawsuit challenging proposed cuts to their health coverage.
The deal provides payments of nearly $19,000 to each of 210 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be curtailed or terminated. It also creates a $500,000 “high risk fund” to help cover certain prescription drug costs not otherwise covered by a retiree’s Medicare Part D plan, and it allows the three class representatives to receive service awards of $15,000 each.

U.S. Judge Finds For 3 Drug Distributors In W.Va. Opioid Lawsuit
Share this Article
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors in a landmark lawsuit that accused them of causing a health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in one West Virginia county ravaged by opioid addiction.
The verdict came nearly a year after closing arguments in a bench trial in the lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.
“The opioid crisis has taken a considerable toll on the citizens of Cabell County and the City of Huntington. And while there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,” U.S. District Judge David Faber wrote in the 184-page ruling. “In view of the court’s findings and conclusions, the court finds that judgment should be entered in defendants’ favor.”
Cabell County attorney Paul Farrell had argued the distributors should be held responsible for sending a “tsunami” of prescription pain pills into the community and that the defendants’ conduct was unreasonable, reckless and disregarded the public’s health and safety in an area ravaged by opioid addiction.
The companies blamed an increase in prescriptions written by doctors along with poor communication and pill quotas set by federal agents.
While the lawsuit alleged the distributors created a public nuisance, Faber said West Virginia’s Supreme Court has only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids “is inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.”
Faber noted that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn’t hold a proper registration from the Drug Enforcement Agency or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.
In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.
The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.
In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.
“Plaintiffs failed to show that the volume of prescription opioids distributed in Cabell/Huntington was because of unreasonable conduct on the part of defendants,” Faber wrote.

Byrd United States Courthouse in Charleston, W.Va., on May 3, 2021, for the start of a trial in an opioid lawsuit filed by Cabell County and the city of Huntington against major drug distributors.

In a statement, Cardinal Health said the judge’s ruling “recognizes what we demonstrated in court, which is that we do not manufacture, market, or prescribe prescription medications but instead only provide a secure channel to deliver medications of all kinds from manufacturers to our thousands of hospital and pharmacy customers that dispense them to their patients based on doctor-ordered prescriptions.
“As we continue to fulfill our limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we operate a constantly adaptive and rigorous system to combat controlled substance diversion and remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they were “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.
“We felt the evidence that emerged from witness statements, company documents, and extensive datasets showed these defendants were responsible for creating and overseeing the infrastructure that flooded West Virginia with opioids. Outcome aside, our appreciation goes out to the first responders, public officials, treatment professionals, researchers, and many others who gave their testimony to bring the truth to light.”
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said the ruling was “a blow to our city and community, but we remain resilient even in the face of adversity.
“The citizens of our city and county should not have to bear the principal responsibility of ensuring that an epidemic of this magnitude never occurs again.”
The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward abatement efforts. The goal of the 15-year abatement plan would have been to reduce overdoses, overdose deaths and the number of people with opioid use disorder.
Last year in Cabell County, an Ohio River county of 93,000 residents, there were 1,067 emergency responses to suspected overdoses — significantly higher than each of the previous three years — with at least 158 deaths. So far this year, suspected overdoses have prompted at least 358 responses and 465 emergency room visits, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health and Human Resources’ Office of Drug Control Policy.

The U.S. addiction crisis was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic with drug overdose deaths surpassing 100,000 in the 12-month period ending in April 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.
The Cabell-Huntington lawsuit was the first time allegations involving opioid distribution ended up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on similar lawsuits. Some have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, including a tentative $161.5 million settlement reached in May by the state of West Virginia with Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies.
In all, more than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and other entities in state and federal courts over the toll of opioids. Most allege that either drug makers, distribution companies or pharmacies created a public nuisance in a crisis that’s been linked to the deaths of 500,000 Americans over the past two decades.

In separate, similar lawsuits, the state of West Virginia reached a $37 million settlement with McKesson in 2019, and $20 million with Cardinal Health and $16 million with AmerisourceBergen in 2017.

HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AND RN UNION EMPLOYEES RATIFY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
Hospital management and RN union employees ratify collective bargaining agreement
Saturday, January 13, 2024
After an exceptional level of collaboration during RN contract negotiations, Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) management and RN union employees today ratified a 3-year collective bargaining agreement. The new agreement replaces a 3-year contract which was in effect from Jan. 15, 2021 through Jan. 15, 2024.
Members of CHH leadership and SEIU 1199 negotiating committees joined together in good faith negotiations for three days this week to finalize a contract that is beneficial for all involved.
“The health care environment has undergone significant changes in recent years,” stated Tim Martin, chief operating officer, CHH. “To best build transparency and collaboration, we listened carefully to learn what truly mattered to the negotiating committee and our nurses, then focused on meeting those needs and enhancing our position as an employer of choice in the region. By doing that, we were able to find common ground and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I commend all members of the negotiation teams for their professionalism and commitment to the process.”

Marshall Medical Outreach (MMO) provides free medical care to the homeless, unemployed and those at risk for homelessness in our city.
MMO is a student-led free mobile health clinic that takes place one Saturday each month in Huntington, West Virginia. Under the guidance of School of Medicine faculty physicians and steadfast community volunteers, MMO offers on-site clinical and social services such as:
health screenings
physical exams
immunizations
ophthalmology services
referrals
over-the-counter medications
Our mission is to provide continuity of care to those in need. Despite programs designed to address the needs of groups such as the homeless and unemployed, many still suffer from chronic and debilitating illnesses that go untreated. Through MMO, we extend our clinical resources as medical students and physicians and provide comprehensive care.

Partnerships Make MMO Possible
Through partnerships with the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health, Marshall University School of Pharmacy, Cabell-Huntington Coalition for the Homeless/ Harmony House, the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, Ebenezer Medical Outreach, and the Bright Clinic, we have treated more than 3,100 patients. Under the supervision of family medicine physician Dr. Katherine Steele, the MMO goal is to establish primary care as well as take care of other minor medical problems for the patients who present each month.
Since 2011, we’ve expanded services to meet the needs of those we serve. In addition to over-the-counter medications, prescriptions are filled under the supervision of Pharmacist, Dr. Robert Stanton. An eye screening station is also available through our partnership with Marshall Eye Surgeons. The screening station is run by students in the ophthalmology interest group. Patients are screened for eye changes caused by diabetes and hypertension, minor eye problems are treated and patients are examined and provided free reading glasses or scheduled for an appointment at the refraction clinic to obtain prescription glasses to meet their needs.
Learning through Leadership
Beyond providing a necessary service, MMO is a chance for students to develop leadership skills that they can take with them into their careers as physicians. Medical students, pharmacy students, residents and attending physicians provide clinical services, while long-term volunteers register the patients and provide needed items like coats, blankets, snacks, water and hygiene items. Building rapport and meeting their immediate needs is important in gaining the trust of this population.
Student leaders, appointed each year, coordinate monthly MMO events. They act as the liaisons between collaborating agencies, including the Mission, Harmony House, and the Cabell Breast Health Center, working closely with community members and city officials to share the goals and needs of MMO to better serve Huntington’s homeless. Amber Vance oversees the purchase and handling of donated items for distribution at MMO. Our medical van driver, Tom Nicholas, (formerly Ron Hackworth “Hack” who served at MMO for nearly nine years), is instrumental in seeing that setup and equipment run smoothly. Hack’s previous services and Tom’s current efforts have been and continue to be invaluable to MMO’s successful operation each month.

Our staff is also active all year participating in community, faith organization, and school health fairs and events, working with many community-based organizations, health clinics and schools. These interactions inform the hospital about community health needs and allow us to respond with appropriate services.
For more information call Huntington Hospital Community Outreach at (626) 397-3376.
Health Counseling
Our registered nurses work in partnership with other community agencies to determine the community’s needs and what can be done to help meet those needs. Free health counseling and screenings for diabetes and hypertension are provided at a variety of community sites every month.
Throughout the year we participate in health fairs, providing free health education for disease prevention and management, and maintaining a healthful lifestyle. We also hold over 30 free annual flu shot clinics throughout the community – providing an average of 2,500 flu shots annually.
Fentanyl Education Program
In response to the national fentanyl poisoning crisis, Huntington Health launched a free fentanyl education program for the community. Huntington-affiliated emergency department physician Ted Peck, MD, and clinical pharmacist specialist Evan Adintori, PharmD, BCPS, and its community outreach team are spearheading the program, which offers free seminars to parents at local schools, and to the public at community centers and libraries.
The seminars cover the dangers of fentanyl, the pervasiveness of the drug in the community and what to do if someone overdoses. They also provide information about Narcan, a nasal spray used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids. Training for administering Narcan for a fentanyl poisoning is offered as well.
If you are interested in hosting this seminar for your organization or school, please email: CommunityOutreach@huntingtonhealth.org

Marshall Medical Outreach (MMO) provides free medical care to the homeless, unemployed and those at risk for homelessness in our city.
MMO is a student-led free mobile health clinic that takes place one Saturday each month in Huntington, West Virginia. Under the guidance of School of Medicine faculty physicians and steadfast community volunteers, MMO offers on-site clinical and social services such as:
health screenings
physical exams
immunizations
ophthalmology services
referrals
over-the-counter medications
Our mission is to provide continuity of care to those in need. Despite programs designed to address the needs of groups such as the homeless and unemployed, many still suffer from chronic and debilitating illnesses that go untreated. Through MMO, we extend our clinical resources as medical students and physicians and provide comprehensive care.

Partnerships Make MMO Possible
Through partnerships with the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health, Marshall University School of Pharmacy, Cabell-Huntington Coalition for the Homeless/ Harmony House, the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, Ebenezer Medical Outreach, and the Bright Clinic, we have treated more than 3,100 patients. Under the supervision of family medicine physician Dr. Katherine Steele, the MMO goal is to establish primary care as well as take care of other minor medical problems for the patients who present each month.
Since 2011, we’ve expanded services to meet the needs of those we serve. In addition to over-the-counter medications, prescriptions are filled under the supervision of Pharmacist, Dr. Robert Stanton. An eye screening station is also available through our partnership with Marshall Eye Surgeons. The screening station is run by students in the ophthalmology interest group. Patients are screened for eye changes caused by diabetes and hypertension, minor eye problems are treated and patients are examined and provided free reading glasses or scheduled for an appointment at the refraction clinic to obtain prescription glasses to meet their needs.
Learning through Leadership
Beyond providing a necessary service, MMO is a chance for students to develop leadership skills that they can take with them into their careers as physicians. Medical students, pharmacy students, residents and attending physicians provide clinical services, while long-term volunteers register the patients and provide needed items like coats, blankets, snacks, water and hygiene items. Building rapport and meeting their immediate needs is important in gaining the trust of this population.
Student leaders, appointed each year, coordinate monthly MMO events. They act as the liaisons between collaborating agencies, including the Mission, Harmony House, and the Cabell Breast Health Center, working closely with community members and city officials to share the goals and needs of MMO to better serve Huntington’s homeless. Amber Vance oversees the purchase and handling of donated items for distribution at MMO. Our medical van driver, Tom Nicholas, (formerly Ron Hackworth “Hack” who served at MMO for nearly nine years), is instrumental in seeing that setup and equipment run smoothly. Hack’s previous services and Tom’s current efforts have been and continue to be invaluable to MMO’s successful operation each month.

Error handling Remi's results: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
Susan: Based on Remi's search results, I have several follow-up questions and suggestions to ensure we gather detailed and actionable information:

### Financial Information
1. **Annual Reports and Financial Statements**:
    - **Remi’s Result**: The result retrieves general hospital profiles but doesn't seem to include specific 2023 annual reports.
    - **Follow-Up**: Can you locate the "FY2023 Annual Report" directly on Cabell Huntington Hospital’s website or through ProPublica/Guidestar?

### Key Decision Makers
2. **Executive Leadership**:
    - **Remi’s Result**: Provided details on leadership but could benefit from more current details on additional roles not listed.
    - **Follow-Up**: Can Remi verify if there have been any recent changes in the executive leadership team and update any newly appointed key figures?

### Labor Relations
3. **News Articles and NLRB**:
    - **Remi’s Result**: Provided news on some recent labor relations activities, including participation in open cases listed on the NLRB.
    - **Follow-Up**: Can you check for any updates on specific open labor relations cases such as “Case Number: 09-CA-332728” filed on 12/29/2023, to get a detailed understanding of the nature of the complaints and any ongoing negotiations?

### Recent Scandals
4. **News Articles**:
    - **Remi’s Result**: Located several pertinent articles on recent scandals involving Medicare penalties, unauthorized access to medical records, and legal disputes with retirees.
    - **Follow-Up**: Can you track the developments in the lawsuit regarding unauthorized access to medical records filed on September 11, 2023? Understanding the proceedings and outcomes will be important.
    - **Legal Disputes**: Are there any further details on the nearly $5.7 million class-action lawsuit settlement with retirees? Are more settlements or appeals expected?

### Other Points of Leverage
5. **Community Impact and Outreach**:
    - **Remi’s Result**: Provided good details on the community outreach programs like Huntington's Kitchen and volunteer services.
    - **Follow-Up**: Could Remi gather metrics on the impact of these programs, such as the number of participants, funds raised, or any significant community feedback? Specific data on these could be very useful.
    - **Further Information**: Can you investigate any detailed reports or reviews from local residents who benefited from these programs to gauge the community sentiment?

### General Follow-Up Questions
6. **Financial Health Metrics**: Are there specific financial health metrics available on databases like Charity Navigator or Hospital Compare?
7. **Board of Directors**: Can Remi provide details on the specific members of the Board of Directors, such as their professional background and any affiliations that might be useful for leverage?
8. **Competitor Comparison**: Could you outline how Cabell Huntington Hospital compares to its local competitors in terms of both services provided and community initiatives?

Overall, more targeted verification and detailed data collection regarding executive leadership changes, legal proceedings updates, and quantifiable community program impacts will greatly support our research brief.
Manny: Sure thing! Based on the follow-up questions and the conversation, here are five specific search queries for Remi:

Tuesday, August 1, 2023
St. Mary’s Medical Center named among Best Hospitals
St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC) and Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), members of Mountain Health Network (MHN), have been recognized in the annual U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals rankings and ratings for 2023-24. The rankings and ratings assist patients and their doctors in choosing the right hospital for them.
SMMC has been recognized among the elite 12% evaluated that earned a Best Hospitals ranking.

This is the sixth consecutive year SMMC has been recognized as a Best Hospital.
SMMC has also been recognized as a High Performing Hospital for back surgery (spinal fusion), COPD, colon cancer surgery, heart attack, heart bypass surgery, heart failure, hip replacement, pneumonia and stroke.

High performing is the highest distinction a hospital can earn for U.S. News’ Best Hospitals Procedures & Conditions ratings. Fewer than half of evaluated hospitals earned any High Performing rating.
“Our physicians and staff have a strong commitment to the health and well-being of the people of our region,” said Hoyt Burdick, MD, chief medical officer, MHN. “We are extremely pleased that commitment has been recognized by such a prestigious organization.”

U.S. News & World Report names Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary’s Medical Center among Best Hospitals 2024-2025 as High Performing
Thursday, July 18, 2024
Marshall Health Network hospitals recognized for eight procedures, conditions
Two Marshall Health Network hospitals have been named by U.S. News & World Report to its 2024-2025 Best Hospitals as High Performing hospitals.
St. Mary’s Medical Center has been recognized as high performing in treating heart attack, heart bypass surgery, heart failure, hip replacement, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cabell Huntington Hospital has been named a high performing hospital for knee replacement and COPD. Of the more than 4,500 hospitals that U.S. News evaluated, only 38% earned even a single high performing rating.
“We are honored to be nationally recognized by U.S. News & World Report for our dedication to advancing health and inspiring hope for all we serve,” said Dr. Kevin Yingling, CEO of Marshall Health Network. “Achieving the highest distinction in U.S. News’ Best Hospitals Procedures & Conditions ratings is a testament to our skilled and compassionate health care team.”
The annual Procedures & Conditions ratings are designed to assist patients and their health care providers in making informed decisions about where to receive care for challenging health conditions or elective procedures. U.S. News evaluated nearly 5,000 hospitals across 15 specialties and 20 procedures and conditions. Hospitals awarded a “Best” designation excelled at factors such as clinical outcomes, level of nursing care and patient experience.
“For 35 years, U.S. News has been a leading resource for patients navigating their health care decisions,” said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News. “The ‘High Performing’ designation acknowledges hospitals that consistently deliver high-quality care for specific medical procedures and conditions. This recognition highlights their expertise and commitment to patient well-being.”
To calculate the Best Hospitals rankings, U.S. News evaluated each hospital’s performance on objective measures such as risk-adjusted mortality rates, preventable complications and level of nursing care. The Best Hospitals Specialty rankings methodology and Procedures Conditions ratings methodology measure patient outcomes using data from millions of records provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
This year, among other methodology refinements, U.S. News incorporated new data on care provided to patients with Medicare Advantage insurance and on care provided to outpatients, nearly doubling the number of patients included in its annual data analysis. The Procedures & Conditions ratings are based entirely on objective quality measures.

Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”

We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC) and Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), members of Mountain Health Network (MHN), have been recognized in the annual Best Hospitals rankings and ratings for 2022-23 by U.S. News & World Report.
SMMC has been recognized among the elite 12% that won Best honors as a Best Hospital in the Metro Valley.

CHH has been recognized as a High Performing Hospital for heart failure, kidney failure, stroke, COPD, hip replacement and knee replacement.
The annual Best Hospitals rankings and ratings, now in their 33rd year, are designed to assist patients and their doctors in making informed decisions about where to receive quality care for challenging health conditions or elective procedures.
“We are truly appreciative and honored to once again be recognized in these prestigious rankings,” said Hoyt Burdick, MD, chief medical officer, MHN. “We are committed to providing advanced medicine and compassionate care to our patients as we continue our work to improve the health and well-being of all we serve.”

In the 15 specialties, 164 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty. State and metro area rankings reflect the highest performing hospitals in the area across multiple areas of care.
“The hospitals recognized excel across numerous specialties and service lines,” said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News. “When patients and their medical professionals are considering their options for care, the rankings are designed to help them identify hospitals that are superior in the kind of care they may need.”
U.S. News evaluated each hospital’s performance using a variety of measures, such as survival rates, complication rates, patient experience and level of nursing care. The Best Hospitals methodology factors in data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, American Hospital Association, professional organizations and medical specialists.

CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL NAMED ONE OF AMERICA’S 100 BEST HOSPITALS FOR 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023
Tuesday, January 17, 2023
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network, today announced that it is one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023. According to new research released by Healthgrades, this achievement puts CHH in the top 2% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures. CHH is the only hospital in West Virginia to be named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals in 2023, and this is the fifth consecutive year the hospital has been among America’s 250 Best Hospitals (2019-2023).
“As a member of Mountain Health Network, Cabell Huntington Hospital is committed to improving the well-being of all we serve,” stated Kevin Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., F.A.C.P, CEO of Mountain Health Network. “This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to quality, which is more important than ever when considering the pandemic’s impact on our health care communities these past few years. We are extremely grateful to our hospital staff members for their dedication to providing highly reliable care to families in our region.”
“Being recognized on a national level from Healthgrades speaks volumes about the level of care we offer at Cabell Huntington Hospital,” said Hoyt Burdick, M.D., chief medical officer of Mountain Health Network. “Our team has remained committed to the highest standards in patient safety and health care quality. This culture of quality and patient safety is shared by everyone at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and is also demonstrated throughout Mountain Health Network. We are thrilled to be recognized for our collective efforts to provide advanced medicine and compassionate care to those in our Tri-State region.”
Healthgrades reports that from 2019-2021, patients treated in hospitals that achieved the top 100 honor, on average, had a 25.5% lower risk of death than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 31 rated conditions and procedures where mortality is the outcome.
“We’re proud to recognize Cabell Huntington Hospital as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals, Cabell Huntington Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT RECOGNIZES MOUNTAIN HEALTH HOSPITALS IN ANNUAL RANKINGS
U.S. News & World Report recognizes Mountain Health hospitals in annual rankings
Tuesday, August 9, 2022
St. Mary’s Medical Center named a Best Hospital in the Metro Valley
St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC) and Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), members of Mountain Health Network (MHN), have been recognized in the annual Best Hospitals rankings and ratings for 2022-23 by U.S. News & World Report.
SMMC has been recognized among the elite 12% that won Best honors as a Best Hospital in the Metro Valley. SMMC was also recognized as a High Performing Hospital for heart bypass surgery, heart failure, heart attack, colon cancer surgery, COPD, kidney failure, pneumonia, hip replacement and knee replacement. CHH has been recognized as a High Performing Hospital for heart failure, kidney failure, stroke, COPD, hip replacement and knee replacement.
The annual Best Hospitals rankings and ratings, now in their 33rd year, are designed to assist patients and their doctors in making informed decisions about where to receive quality care for challenging health conditions or elective procedures.
“We are truly appreciative and honored to once again be recognized in these prestigious rankings,” said Hoyt Burdick, MD, chief medical officer, MHN. “We are committed to providing advanced medicine and compassionate care to our patients as we continue our work to improve the health and well-being of all we serve.”
For the 2022-2023 rankings and ratings, U.S. News evaluated more than 4,500 hospitals across 15 specialties and 20 procedures and conditions. In the 15 specialties, 164 hospitals were ranked in at least one specialty. State and metro area rankings reflect the highest performing hospitals in the area across multiple areas of care.
“The hospitals recognized excel across numerous specialties and service lines,” said Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News. “When patients and their medical professionals are considering their options for care, the rankings are designed to help them identify hospitals that are superior in the kind of care they may need.”
U.S. News evaluated each hospital’s performance using a variety of measures, such as survival rates, complication rates, patient experience and level of nursing care. The Best Hospitals methodology factors in data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, American Hospital Association, professional organizations and medical specialists.

Marshall Health, Marshall University, and Mountain Health Network boards approve first step toward clinical integration
April 25, 2023
SHARE
Marshall Health, Marshall University and Mountain Health Network governing boards voted unanimously this week to authorize signing a letter of intent to form an integrated academic health system with the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.
Guided by each of their missions, the newly integrated academic health system will consist of Mountain Health Network’s four hospitals: Cabell Huntington Hospital, St. Mary’s Medical Center, Hoops Family Children’s Hospital and Pleasant Valley Hospital; its ambulatory facilities, medical offices and employed physician practices; and Marshall Health’s physician practice and its facilities.
“Hospitals, physicians, and medical schools across the country are realizing the value of more closely aligning and harnessing the strengths of each entity to benefit the patients they serve,” stated Mountain Health Network CEO Kevin W. Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., FACP. “The hospitals, physician practice and medical school have a strong history of collaboration and the time is right to formalize our relationship.”
“While our institutions have collaborated for nearly 50 years, this letter of intent marks the beginning of our evolution into a true academic health system,” said Beth L. Hammers, M.B.A., CEO of Marshall Health. “Our commitment to our faculty, students, patients, team members and community will remain at the forefront as we align our missions and speak with one voice to transform health care in West Virginia and beyond.”
Marshall University President Brad D. Smith said the formation of the integrated academic health system embodies the history the organizations share and presents a significant opportunity for the future.
“The most powerful word in our university’s rally cry – We Are Marshall – is the word “we,” said Smith.  “Education and research are central to the mission of the new academic health system, and this alignment will strengthen the educational experience and opportunities for research and discovery for Marshall University students. Equally important, our centers of excellence in addiction medicine, obesity, gerontology and rural health will continue to flourish and enhance our abilities to meet the needs of our population. In combination, we will advance our role as a prosperity platform, accelerating individual success, innovative ideas and economic impact in the community and greater Appalachian region.”
The formation of an academic health system will drive the delivery of high-quality multidisciplinary care, provide a forum for training the next generation of health care providers and advance research opportunities aimed at improving the health and wellness of patients and communities across West Virginia and the bordering states of Kentucky and Ohio.
The letter of intent is the first step in the process that enables the three entities to proceed with the necessary due diligence and governing documents that result in a definitive agreement. All three entities are committed to completing the process by the end of the year. More information will be shared as the process continues.

Cabell Huntington (W.Va.) Hospital President and CEO Kevin N. Fowler said the Huntington area will experience significant growth within the next five to 10 years, allowing the system to become a top healthcare provider and provide the types of services available in larger urban cities like Cincinnati or Pittsburgh, according to The State Journal.
Mr. Fowler told the publication the ever-changing hospital landscape has motivated numerous health systems nationwide to band together and "work … with hospitals they competed against in the past. Fortunately, here in Huntington, we have two entities that recognize the value of coming together, and I think that is going to be key to going forward."

Cabell Huntington (W.Va.) Hospital officials said Tuesday the hospital has agreed to work with one of the strongest opponents of the hospital's proposed merger with Huntington, W.Va.-based St. Mary's Medical Center, ending a pending four-year legal challenge, according to The Herald-Dispatch.
Steel of West Virginia, a Huntington-based steel producer, has been one of the strongest opponents of the proposed merger between Cabell Huntington and St. Mary's Medical Center. The company filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court arguing the deal would create a healthcare monopoly in the area and raise costs for patients.

MARSHALL HEALTH NETWORK CEO ANNOUNCES PLANS TO RETIRE
Marshall Health Network CEO announces plans to retire
Monday, April 29, 2024
Dr. Kevin Yingling, RPh, M.D., FACP
Dr. Kevin Yingling has advised the Marshall Health Network (MHN) Board of Directors of his plans to retire as the CEO of MHN next year.
“It has been my honor and privilege to serve the patients, community and region,” said Dr. Yingling. “As I look across Marshall Health Network, I am inspired by the talent and positive momentum of our team, and I know that together, we will continue to reach new milestones. I look forward to working with the MHN board of directors throughout the selection process for the next CEO to guide our system forward.”
“We are deeply grateful to Dr. Yingling for his many contributions to MHN,” said David Fox, chair, MHN board of directors. “As the first CEO of MHN, Dr. Yingling sought to understand the system’s needs as he led us through the challenges of COVID, welcomed Rivers Health to the system, developed relationships that supported growth throughout the region, and unified the health system with Joan C. Edwards Marshall University School of Medicine and Marshall Health to create our newly integrated academic health system. Perhaps most important, Dr. Yingling instilled a spirit of servant leadership. His kindness, compassion and collaboration have created a strong foundation we will continue to build upon at MHN.”
The MHN board has developed a CEO selection committee comprised of board members and leadership and selected an executive firm to begin the process of a national CEO search. Upon selection of the next CEO, Dr. Yingling has committed to supporting the transition and onboarding of the new CEO.

Marshall Health, Marshall University, and Mountain Health Network boards approve first step toward clinical integration
April 25, 2023
SHARE
Marshall Health, Marshall University and Mountain Health Network governing boards voted unanimously this week to authorize signing a letter of intent to form an integrated academic health system with the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.
Guided by each of their missions, the newly integrated academic health system will consist of Mountain Health Network’s four hospitals: Cabell Huntington Hospital, St. Mary’s Medical Center, Hoops Family Children’s Hospital and Pleasant Valley Hospital; its ambulatory facilities, medical offices and employed physician practices; and Marshall Health’s physician practice and its facilities.
“Hospitals, physicians, and medical schools across the country are realizing the value of more closely aligning and harnessing the strengths of each entity to benefit the patients they serve,” stated Mountain Health Network CEO Kevin W. Yingling, R.Ph., M.D., FACP. “The hospitals, physician practice and medical school have a strong history of collaboration and the time is right to formalize our relationship.”
“While our institutions have collaborated for nearly 50 years, this letter of intent marks the beginning of our evolution into a true academic health system,” said Beth L. Hammers, M.B.A., CEO of Marshall Health. “Our commitment to our faculty, students, patients, team members and community will remain at the forefront as we align our missions and speak with one voice to transform health care in West Virginia and beyond.”
Marshall University President Brad D. Smith said the formation of the integrated academic health system embodies the history the organizations share and presents a significant opportunity for the future.
“The most powerful word in our university’s rally cry – We Are Marshall – is the word “we,” said Smith.  “Education and research are central to the mission of the new academic health system, and this alignment will strengthen the educational experience and opportunities for research and discovery for Marshall University students. Equally important, our centers of excellence in addiction medicine, obesity, gerontology and rural health will continue to flourish and enhance our abilities to meet the needs of our population. In combination, we will advance our role as a prosperity platform, accelerating individual success, innovative ideas and economic impact in the community and greater Appalachian region.”
The formation of an academic health system will drive the delivery of high-quality multidisciplinary care, provide a forum for training the next generation of health care providers and advance research opportunities aimed at improving the health and wellness of patients and communities across West Virginia and the bordering states of Kentucky and Ohio.
The letter of intent is the first step in the process that enables the three entities to proceed with the necessary due diligence and governing documents that result in a definitive agreement. All three entities are committed to completing the process by the end of the year. More information will be shared as the process continues.

Cabell Huntington (W.Va.) Hospital officials said Tuesday the hospital has agreed to work with one of the strongest opponents of the hospital's proposed merger with Huntington, W.Va.-based St. Mary's Medical Center, ending a pending four-year legal challenge, according to The Herald-Dispatch.
Steel of West Virginia, a Huntington-based steel producer, has been one of the strongest opponents of the proposed merger between Cabell Huntington and St. Mary's Medical Center. The company filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court arguing the deal would create a healthcare monopoly in the area and raise costs for patients.

  LEGAL UPDATES
College athletes will return to competition in a few weeks. They will also return to the courtroom. This time, it relates to the treatment of student-athletes under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). On May 18, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) Los Angeles Regional Office (Region 31) filed a single complaint against three respondents—the University of Southern California (USC), the Pac-12 Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)—alleging certain USC athletes are statutory employees of each of the three respondents under the NLRA. If successful, students who play men’s basketball, women’s basketball, or football at any NCAA member institution will be granted full rights as “employees” under the NLRA, including the right to organize a union, join a union, or engage in protected concerted activity, among other rights. 
Following the complaint, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo stated misclassifying college athletes as “student-athletes” instead of employees “deprives these players of their statutory right to organize and to join together to improve their working/playing conditions if they wish to do so. Our aim is to ensure that these players can fully and freely exercise their rights.”
GC Memo 21-08: Factors supporting finding college athletes are employees
Readers who follow Husch Blackwell’s Labor Law Insider podcast or who have been following NLRB developments will not be surprised by Abruzzo’s 2021 Memorandum, GC Memo 21-08, where she criticized the NCAA’s use of the phrases “student-athlete” and “amateurism.” Abruzzo, relying on the Board’s unanimous decision in Northwestern University, 362 NLRB 1350 (2015), cited the following factors to support a finding that college athletes are employees under the Act:
The athletes play football (perform a service) for both the university and the NCAA, generating tens of millions of dollars in profit and providing an immeasurable positive impact on the university’s reputation, which in turn boosts student applications and alumni financial donations;
Football players receive significant compensation, including up to $76,000 per year covering their tuition, fees, room, board, and books, and a stipend covering additional expenses such as travel and childcare;
The NCAA controls the players’ terms and conditions of employment, including the maximum number of practice and competition hours, scholarship eligibility, limits on compensation, minimum grade point average, and restrictions on gifts and benefits players may accept, and ensures compliance with those rules through its “Compliance Assistance Program” and;
The university controls the manner and means of the players’ work on the field and various facets of the players’ daily lives to ensure compliance with NCAA rules. For example, the university maintains detailed itineraries regarding the players’ daily activities and training, enforces the NCAA’s minimum GPA requirement, and penalizes players for any university or NCAA infractions, which could result in removal from the team and loss of their scholarship.
According to Abruzzo, “the scholarship football players at issue in Northwestern clearly satisfy the broad Section 2(3) definition of ‘employee and the common-law test,’” and “football players, and other similarly situated players at academic institutions, should be protected by Section 7 when they act concertedly to speak out about their terms and conditions of employment, or to self-organize, regardless of whether the Board ultimately certifies a bargaining unit.”
In Northwestern University, the Board did not rule on the issue of whether college football players are employees. Instead, the Board declined to exercise jurisdiction because of NCAA complexities, including potential issues concerning public schools in the NCAA over which the Board has no jurisdiction, and the potential for labor unrest.
The USC case
In addition to the issue of whether college athletes are statutory employees under the Act, the USC case is the first to consider whether the Pac-12 and the NCAA are joint employers. Finding joint employer status for NCAA players opens the possibility of union representation of athletes from both private and public NCAA member institutions. Such a decision would allow over 100,000 college athletes playing football and men’s and women’s basketball—including approximately 41,000 players in Division I alone—to join a union. The complaint alleges the parties are joint employers because the NCAA and the Pac-12 have control over USC’s labor relations polices and/or administer a common labor policy with USC with respect to college athletes. If found to be joint employers, the parties can be held liable for each other’s actions and violations under the NLRA. The USC case is set to be heard by an administrative law judge on November 7, 2023.
Considerations for the new school year
Colleges and universities should be aware of the issues presented in the USC case and consider how a NLRB decision finding college athletes to be statutory employees under the NLRA could impact their organization and consider steps to ensure NLRA compliance.
Protected concerted activity
Assuming they are statutory employees as the Board alleges, many college athletes participate in protected concerted activities as defined in Section 7 of the Act through their participation in Student-Athlete Advisory Committees (SAACs) and other department leadership councils. SAACs are NCAA-mandated organizations formed at each NCAA member institution. SAACs allow athletes to offer input on NCAA legislation, advocate to administration about concerns, and promote athlete engagement. Other concerted activities include communications and acts to prepare for group actions, such as those seen during the 2020 Big Ten United and Pac-12 #WeAreUnited campaigns, where college athletes demanded enhancements to COVID-19 protocols and firmer commitments to racial justice from their universities and conferences. If college athletes are found to be statutory employees under the act, coaches and administrators will not be able to speak with players about concerted activities, including asking common questions about involvement in campus protests or planned protest activities.
Other activity likely to be considered protected includes athletes’ reports made through systems like RealResponse or other anonymous campus climate and reporting mechanisms. If an athlete brings a concern directly to a coach or administrator implicating a team-wide issue, such activity would be protected and coaches and administrators would need to take steps to ensure adverse actions, and those perceived as such, are not taken. Adverse actions might include reduced playing time, schedule changes, and other team-membership—i.e., employment-related perks. Whether statutory employees are members of a union or not, they have the right to participate in protected concerted activities under the Act.
Handbooks
As one of her first acts as general counsel, Abruzzo issued GC memo 21-04 to all regional directors outlining her areas of focus, including employer handbooks. Abruzzo directed regional directors to impose additional scrutiny on handbook policies such as perceived overly broad social media rules allegedly restricting employees’ Section 7 rights.
Providing statutory protections to college athletes will open any employee handbook issued by a covered university to NLRB scrutiny, regardless of whether the athletes are represented by a union. Under The Boeing Company, handbook policies are evaluated by the nature and extent of their potential impact on NLRA rights and legitimate justifications associated with the rule. Schools should review their policies in light of this standard. Social media policies prohibiting athletes from posting negative opinions about athletics programs or general monitoring of accounts for disciplinary action could be seen as unlawful. Policy limitations on athlete access to the media—such as preventing, for example, freshmen athletes from attending press conferences or not allowing media access after a loss—could also be viewed as an unreasonable restraint on Section 7 rights.
What this means to you
Although the USC case is about football and men’s and women’s basketball players, the decision will impact thousands of college athletes in other sports as well. If players can form a union and are able to command significant pay, athletic departments may be forced to cut scholarships or sports, a prevalent post-COVID-19 trend. The decision also could clarify next steps for those non-football and non-basketball athletes, who, based on the scope of the decision, might be able to organize. Schools should consider taking steps now to educate and protect themselves against unfair labor practice charges in advance of the November 7, 2023, hearing. Education on concerted activities and updated, legally compliant personnel and handbook policies may help shield NCAA schools from the NLRA’s costly penalty flags and personal fouls.

On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it will hear a challenge in a key case involving the ease with which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may successfully petition a district court for injunctive relief in unfair labor practice (ULP) cases.
The outcome of this case likely will have a significant impact on the legal strategies available to employers in litigating a ULP.
Starbucks & the Proper Standard for 10(j) Injunctions  
A hotly contested issue that both the NLRB and circuit courts have debated for years is the appropriate standard for determining whether to grant a Section 10(j) injunction under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This question was presented to the Supreme Court in a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by Starbucks in Starbucks v. McKinney, after the Sixth Circuit upheld a 10(j) injunction requiring Starbucks to reinstate seven employees during the pendency of the employees’ ULP charge.
As previously discussed here, Section 10(j) of the NLRA authorizes the NLRB to seek injunctive relief in federal court to remedy an alleged unfair labor practice while the merits of the underlying case are being litigated. However, for decades, circuit courts have been split as to the proper analysis for deciding whether this exceptional remedy should be granted.
Some circuits, such as the Sixth, Fifth and Tenth Circuits, follow a two-factor test to determine whether a 10(j) injunction is appropriate and look to: (i) whether there is “reasonable cause” to believe that ULPs have occurred; and (ii) whether injunctive relief is “just and proper.”
Other circuits, including the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Circuits, adopt a four-factor test weighing: (i) whether the NLRB is likely to succeed on the merits of the underlying case; (ii) whether denying the injunction would cause “irreparable harm;” (iii) the balance between the parties’ interest; and (iv) whether an injunction would serve the public interest.
Starbucks petitioned the Supreme Court to resolve this “entrenched” and “frequently recurring” circuit split once and for all. Starbucks takes the position that the two-factor test applied by the Sixth Circuit and others does not impose a sufficiently “onerous or heavy” burden on the NLRB and, as a result, these courts end up granting this special remedy too easily.
Conversely, Starbucks argues that the four-factor test applied by the Fourth Circuit and others imposes an appropriately-significant burden on the NLRB, which ensures that a 10(j) injunction continues to be a “drastic and extraordinary remedy which should not be granted as a matter of course,” as initially intended by the Supreme Court.
Throughout her tenure, NLRB General Counsel Abruzzo has openly encouraged all NLRB Regional Offices to utilize 10(j) injunctions, deeming them to be “one of the most important tools available to effectively enforce the Act” (see our previous post here). Indeed, Starbucks reported that the NLRB, as of October 3, 2023, had already filed ten 10(j) injunction petitions against the company in the prior 18 months alone. As such, it is clear that General Counsel Abruzzo’s plan is well underway, and we can continue to expect to see requests for injunctive relief used more regularly by NLRB Regional Offices against employers. However, the success of these petitions will ultimately hinge on the test adopted by the Supreme Court in Starbucks and the weight of the burden imposed on the Board to demonstrate that a 10(j) injunction is warranted.
The Supreme Court’s decision in this case will thus have a significant effect on employers and unions, as well as on the NLRB’s ability successfully seek 10(j) injunctions in federal court. Given the import of this decision, we will continue to monitor the latest developments and report any updates here.

Sixth Circuit Panel Questions Board’s Emergency Pay Increase Ruling
By Paul Salvatore, Joshua Fox & Austin McLeod on May 13, 2024
On May 9, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard oral argument regarding the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) exception allowing an employer to unilaterally make decisions during an emergency.  The Board sought court enforcement of its ruling that Metro Man IV LLC failed to notify SEIU Healthcare Michigan about its emergency decisions to increase pay and hire non-union workers and failed to bargain about those decisions and their effects. 
Background
Metro Man, a company doing business in Detroit as a health and rehabilitation center, was faced with a staffing shortage due to the Pandemic in March 2020.  Approximately 70% of staff stopped coming to work when residents started contracting Covid-19.  In response, without notifying the union, the company increased pay $2 per hour and when that did not improve staffing, hired non-union workers.  The company removed the increase when it determined the emergency ended (i.e., once the facility was Covid free in June) and discharged the new workers before the end of the year.  In December 2022, the Board ruled that while the emergency allowed the company to make the wage and staffing decisions, the company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) when it failed to notify the union of its changes and failed to bargain over the decisions and their effects after the need for an immediate decision passed.
Sixth Circuit Oral Argument
During oral argument, Judge John Nalbandian, appeared to adopt an argument presented by Metro Man, stating that the Board was “expanding its power” when it required the employer to bargain with the union over the pay increase in response to its pandemic-based staffing shortage.  In response, the NLRB attorney attempted to clarify, claiming, “[t]he Board isn’t expanding its rule; the Board is interpreting its rule on a different set of facts, which perhaps has broader implications.”  The attorney also argued that the permissible employer’s decision to increase pay during the emergency was separate from its decision of when the increase would end, which it could not unilaterally determine months later.  In response, Judge John Bush pushed back, observing, “I think the benchmark that was set was it would end when Covid was out of the facility,” a reference to the employer’s original staff announcement that the increase would be in place as long as Covid patients were in the building.  
During one exchange, the attorney for Metro Man provided a sobering reminder of the context in which the employer found itself during that emergency.  In response to Judge Nalbandian’s question of why the employer couldn’t have emailed the union informing it about the pay and personnel changes, the attorney responded: “When you’re spending 12 hours a day trying to get people to pick up dead bodies and you’re going to 7-11 to get bags of ice, you don’t have a lot of time on your hands.”  However, it is worth noting that the Administrative Law Judge specifically rejected a Metro Man employee’s testimony that she was unable to contact the union regarding the increase due to having no time, given she conceded she was able to use email and company phones in April and June.
Takeaways
Based on the exchanges between the panel and the parties, the panel appeared skeptical of the Board second-guessing the employer’s actions during a dire emergency.  It remains to be seen whether the Sixth Circuit will uphold the Board’s ruling that Metro Man violated the NLRA.  While these cases are difficult, with courts often being asked to revisit times of catastrophe to determine whether the parties acted in accordance with the law, hopefully, this case will provide more guidance as to when an employer needs to bargain over decisions made during an emergency, which aspects of those decisions need to be bargained, as well as when notice of such decisions is required.  As always, we will continue to update you on these developments.

  LEGAL UPDATES
College athletes will return to competition in a few weeks. They will also return to the courtroom. This time, it relates to the treatment of student-athletes under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). On May 18, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) Los Angeles Regional Office (Region 31) filed a single complaint against three respondents—the University of Southern California (USC), the Pac-12 Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)—alleging certain USC athletes are statutory employees of each of the three respondents under the NLRA. If successful, students who play men’s basketball, women’s basketball, or football at any NCAA member institution will be granted full rights as “employees” under the NLRA, including the right to organize a union, join a union, or engage in protected concerted activity, among other rights. 
Following the complaint, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo stated misclassifying college athletes as “student-athletes” instead of employees “deprives these players of their statutory right to organize and to join together to improve their working/playing conditions if they wish to do so. Our aim is to ensure that these players can fully and freely exercise their rights.”
GC Memo 21-08: Factors supporting finding college athletes are employees
Readers who follow Husch Blackwell’s Labor Law Insider podcast or who have been following NLRB developments will not be surprised by Abruzzo’s 2021 Memorandum, GC Memo 21-08, where she criticized the NCAA’s use of the phrases “student-athlete” and “amateurism.” Abruzzo, relying on the Board’s unanimous decision in Northwestern University, 362 NLRB 1350 (2015), cited the following factors to support a finding that college athletes are employees under the Act:
The athletes play football (perform a service) for both the university and the NCAA, generating tens of millions of dollars in profit and providing an immeasurable positive impact on the university’s reputation, which in turn boosts student applications and alumni financial donations;
Football players receive significant compensation, including up to $76,000 per year covering their tuition, fees, room, board, and books, and a stipend covering additional expenses such as travel and childcare;
The NCAA controls the players’ terms and conditions of employment, including the maximum number of practice and competition hours, scholarship eligibility, limits on compensation, minimum grade point average, and restrictions on gifts and benefits players may accept, and ensures compliance with those rules through its “Compliance Assistance Program” and;
The university controls the manner and means of the players’ work on the field and various facets of the players’ daily lives to ensure compliance with NCAA rules. For example, the university maintains detailed itineraries regarding the players’ daily activities and training, enforces the NCAA’s minimum GPA requirement, and penalizes players for any university or NCAA infractions, which could result in removal from the team and loss of their scholarship.
According to Abruzzo, “the scholarship football players at issue in Northwestern clearly satisfy the broad Section 2(3) definition of ‘employee and the common-law test,’” and “football players, and other similarly situated players at academic institutions, should be protected by Section 7 when they act concertedly to speak out about their terms and conditions of employment, or to self-organize, regardless of whether the Board ultimately certifies a bargaining unit.”
In Northwestern University, the Board did not rule on the issue of whether college football players are employees. Instead, the Board declined to exercise jurisdiction because of NCAA complexities, including potential issues concerning public schools in the NCAA over which the Board has no jurisdiction, and the potential for labor unrest.
The USC case
In addition to the issue of whether college athletes are statutory employees under the Act, the USC case is the first to consider whether the Pac-12 and the NCAA are joint employers. Finding joint employer status for NCAA players opens the possibility of union representation of athletes from both private and public NCAA member institutions. Such a decision would allow over 100,000 college athletes playing football and men’s and women’s basketball—including approximately 41,000 players in Division I alone—to join a union. The complaint alleges the parties are joint employers because the NCAA and the Pac-12 have control over USC’s labor relations polices and/or administer a common labor policy with USC with respect to college athletes. If found to be joint employers, the parties can be held liable for each other’s actions and violations under the NLRA. The USC case is set to be heard by an administrative law judge on November 7, 2023.
Considerations for the new school year
Colleges and universities should be aware of the issues presented in the USC case and consider how a NLRB decision finding college athletes to be statutory employees under the NLRA could impact their organization and consider steps to ensure NLRA compliance.
Protected concerted activity
Assuming they are statutory employees as the Board alleges, many college athletes participate in protected concerted activities as defined in Section 7 of the Act through their participation in Student-Athlete Advisory Committees (SAACs) and other department leadership councils. SAACs are NCAA-mandated organizations formed at each NCAA member institution. SAACs allow athletes to offer input on NCAA legislation, advocate to administration about concerns, and promote athlete engagement. Other concerted activities include communications and acts to prepare for group actions, such as those seen during the 2020 Big Ten United and Pac-12 #WeAreUnited campaigns, where college athletes demanded enhancements to COVID-19 protocols and firmer commitments to racial justice from their universities and conferences. If college athletes are found to be statutory employees under the act, coaches and administrators will not be able to speak with players about concerted activities, including asking common questions about involvement in campus protests or planned protest activities.
Other activity likely to be considered protected includes athletes’ reports made through systems like RealResponse or other anonymous campus climate and reporting mechanisms. If an athlete brings a concern directly to a coach or administrator implicating a team-wide issue, such activity would be protected and coaches and administrators would need to take steps to ensure adverse actions, and those perceived as such, are not taken. Adverse actions might include reduced playing time, schedule changes, and other team-membership—i.e., employment-related perks. Whether statutory employees are members of a union or not, they have the right to participate in protected concerted activities under the Act.
Handbooks
As one of her first acts as general counsel, Abruzzo issued GC memo 21-04 to all regional directors outlining her areas of focus, including employer handbooks. Abruzzo directed regional directors to impose additional scrutiny on handbook policies such as perceived overly broad social media rules allegedly restricting employees’ Section 7 rights.
Providing statutory protections to college athletes will open any employee handbook issued by a covered university to NLRB scrutiny, regardless of whether the athletes are represented by a union. Under The Boeing Company, handbook policies are evaluated by the nature and extent of their potential impact on NLRA rights and legitimate justifications associated with the rule. Schools should review their policies in light of this standard. Social media policies prohibiting athletes from posting negative opinions about athletics programs or general monitoring of accounts for disciplinary action could be seen as unlawful. Policy limitations on athlete access to the media—such as preventing, for example, freshmen athletes from attending press conferences or not allowing media access after a loss—could also be viewed as an unreasonable restraint on Section 7 rights.
What this means to you
Although the USC case is about football and men’s and women’s basketball players, the decision will impact thousands of college athletes in other sports as well. If players can form a union and are able to command significant pay, athletic departments may be forced to cut scholarships or sports, a prevalent post-COVID-19 trend. The decision also could clarify next steps for those non-football and non-basketball athletes, who, based on the scope of the decision, might be able to organize. Schools should consider taking steps now to educate and protect themselves against unfair labor practice charges in advance of the November 7, 2023, hearing. Education on concerted activities and updated, legally compliant personnel and handbook policies may help shield NCAA schools from the NLRA’s costly penalty flags and personal fouls.

On January 12, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it will hear a challenge in a key case involving the ease with which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may successfully petition a district court for injunctive relief in unfair labor practice (ULP) cases.
The outcome of this case likely will have a significant impact on the legal strategies available to employers in litigating a ULP.
Starbucks & the Proper Standard for 10(j) Injunctions  
A hotly contested issue that both the NLRB and circuit courts have debated for years is the appropriate standard for determining whether to grant a Section 10(j) injunction under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This question was presented to the Supreme Court in a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by Starbucks in Starbucks v. McKinney, after the Sixth Circuit upheld a 10(j) injunction requiring Starbucks to reinstate seven employees during the pendency of the employees’ ULP charge.
As previously discussed here, Section 10(j) of the NLRA authorizes the NLRB to seek injunctive relief in federal court to remedy an alleged unfair labor practice while the merits of the underlying case are being litigated. However, for decades, circuit courts have been split as to the proper analysis for deciding whether this exceptional remedy should be granted.
Some circuits, such as the Sixth, Fifth and Tenth Circuits, follow a two-factor test to determine whether a 10(j) injunction is appropriate and look to: (i) whether there is “reasonable cause” to believe that ULPs have occurred; and (ii) whether injunctive relief is “just and proper.”
Other circuits, including the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Circuits, adopt a four-factor test weighing: (i) whether the NLRB is likely to succeed on the merits of the underlying case; (ii) whether denying the injunction would cause “irreparable harm;” (iii) the balance between the parties’ interest; and (iv) whether an injunction would serve the public interest.
Starbucks petitioned the Supreme Court to resolve this “entrenched” and “frequently recurring” circuit split once and for all. Starbucks takes the position that the two-factor test applied by the Sixth Circuit and others does not impose a sufficiently “onerous or heavy” burden on the NLRB and, as a result, these courts end up granting this special remedy too easily.
Conversely, Starbucks argues that the four-factor test applied by the Fourth Circuit and others imposes an appropriately-significant burden on the NLRB, which ensures that a 10(j) injunction continues to be a “drastic and extraordinary remedy which should not be granted as a matter of course,” as initially intended by the Supreme Court.
Throughout her tenure, NLRB General Counsel Abruzzo has openly encouraged all NLRB Regional Offices to utilize 10(j) injunctions, deeming them to be “one of the most important tools available to effectively enforce the Act” (see our previous post here). Indeed, Starbucks reported that the NLRB, as of October 3, 2023, had already filed ten 10(j) injunction petitions against the company in the prior 18 months alone. As such, it is clear that General Counsel Abruzzo’s plan is well underway, and we can continue to expect to see requests for injunctive relief used more regularly by NLRB Regional Offices against employers. However, the success of these petitions will ultimately hinge on the test adopted by the Supreme Court in Starbucks and the weight of the burden imposed on the Board to demonstrate that a 10(j) injunction is warranted.
The Supreme Court’s decision in this case will thus have a significant effect on employers and unions, as well as on the NLRB’s ability successfully seek 10(j) injunctions in federal court. Given the import of this decision, we will continue to monitor the latest developments and report any updates here.

Sixth Circuit Panel Questions Board’s Emergency Pay Increase Ruling
By Paul Salvatore, Joshua Fox & Austin McLeod on May 13, 2024
On May 9, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard oral argument regarding the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) exception allowing an employer to unilaterally make decisions during an emergency.  The Board sought court enforcement of its ruling that Metro Man IV LLC failed to notify SEIU Healthcare Michigan about its emergency decisions to increase pay and hire non-union workers and failed to bargain about those decisions and their effects. 
Background
Metro Man, a company doing business in Detroit as a health and rehabilitation center, was faced with a staffing shortage due to the Pandemic in March 2020.  Approximately 70% of staff stopped coming to work when residents started contracting Covid-19.  In response, without notifying the union, the company increased pay $2 per hour and when that did not improve staffing, hired non-union workers.  The company removed the increase when it determined the emergency ended (i.e., once the facility was Covid free in June) and discharged the new workers before the end of the year.  In December 2022, the Board ruled that while the emergency allowed the company to make the wage and staffing decisions, the company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) when it failed to notify the union of its changes and failed to bargain over the decisions and their effects after the need for an immediate decision passed.
Sixth Circuit Oral Argument
During oral argument, Judge John Nalbandian, appeared to adopt an argument presented by Metro Man, stating that the Board was “expanding its power” when it required the employer to bargain with the union over the pay increase in response to its pandemic-based staffing shortage.  In response, the NLRB attorney attempted to clarify, claiming, “[t]he Board isn’t expanding its rule; the Board is interpreting its rule on a different set of facts, which perhaps has broader implications.”  The attorney also argued that the permissible employer’s decision to increase pay during the emergency was separate from its decision of when the increase would end, which it could not unilaterally determine months later.  In response, Judge John Bush pushed back, observing, “I think the benchmark that was set was it would end when Covid was out of the facility,” a reference to the employer’s original staff announcement that the increase would be in place as long as Covid patients were in the building.  
During one exchange, the attorney for Metro Man provided a sobering reminder of the context in which the employer found itself during that emergency.  In response to Judge Nalbandian’s question of why the employer couldn’t have emailed the union informing it about the pay and personnel changes, the attorney responded: “When you’re spending 12 hours a day trying to get people to pick up dead bodies and you’re going to 7-11 to get bags of ice, you don’t have a lot of time on your hands.”  However, it is worth noting that the Administrative Law Judge specifically rejected a Metro Man employee’s testimony that she was unable to contact the union regarding the increase due to having no time, given she conceded she was able to use email and company phones in April and June.
Takeaways
Based on the exchanges between the panel and the parties, the panel appeared skeptical of the Board second-guessing the employer’s actions during a dire emergency.  It remains to be seen whether the Sixth Circuit will uphold the Board’s ruling that Metro Man violated the NLRA.  While these cases are difficult, with courts often being asked to revisit times of catastrophe to determine whether the parties acted in accordance with the law, hopefully, this case will provide more guidance as to when an employer needs to bargain over decisions made during an emergency, which aspects of those decisions need to be bargained, as well as when notice of such decisions is required.  As always, we will continue to update you on these developments.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

JANE DOE, Plaintiff, v. CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL, INC., Defendant.
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Pending is Plaintiff Jane Doe's Motion to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 2), filed June 15, 2023. Defendant Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. filed a response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion (ECF No. 11) on August 7, 2023, and Plaintiff filed a reply memorandum on August 21, 2023 (ECF No. 14).
For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED.
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that in August 2022 Plaintiff scheduled an appointment with Defendant Cabell Huntington Hospital's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine (“CARM”) for October 10, 2022. Compl. ¶ 8. Plaintiff was ultimately unable to attend her appointment. Id. at ¶ 9.
On or about November 8, 2022, Plaintiff alleges that she learned “that two employees of Defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared Plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same.” Id. at ¶ 11. Plaintiff did not give the Defendant or its agents permission to share her confidential medical information. Id. at ¶ 13.
In fact, at the time of Defendant's alleged disclosure of her information Plaintiff “had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.” Id. at ¶ 10.
As a result of this unauthorized disclosure of her medical information, Plaintiff alleges that she has suffered “unnecessary embarrassment” and exacerbated anxiety. Id. at ¶ 12.
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See id. at ¶¶ 6-7. The Complaint asserts two causes of action against Defendant: (I) negligent training, supervision, and retention; and (II) invasion of privacy.
Plaintiff now asks the Court to allow her to proceed in this litigation anonymously. Defendant has responded in opposition.
II. LEGAL STANDARD
Generally, a civil complaint “must name all the parties” to the action. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 10(a). This “rule recognizes ‘the general presumption of openness of judicial proceedings,' which has a basis both in common law and in the First Amendment.” Doe v. Doe, 85 F.4th 206, 210 (4th Cir. 2023). The Fourth Circuit has expounded that “‘[p]seudonymous litigation undermines the public undermines the public's right of access to judicial proceedings' because ‘[t]he public has an interest in knowing the names of litigants, and disclosing the parties' identities furthers openness of judicial proceedings.'” Id. at 210-11 (quoting Doe v. Public Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 274 (4th Cir. 2014)) (alterations in original).
As this Court previously has stated, whether a party should be permitted to proceed anonymously rests in “‘the sound discretion of the district court.'” W. M. v. Braskem Am., Inc., No. 3:20-CV-00141, 2020 WL 1492544, at *1 (S.D. W.Va. Mar. 26, 2020) (quoting Doe v. Alger, 317 F.R.D. 37, 39 (W.D. Va. 2016)). This has recently been affirmed by the Fourth Circuit. Doe, 85 F.4th at 210.
In making an anonymity decision, the Court considers the five factors set forth by the Fourth Circuit in James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233 (4th Cir. 1993). These factors are:
[1] whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; [2] whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the requesting party or even more critically, to innocent non-parties; [3] the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; [4] whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and [5] the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously.
6 F.3d at 238 (citations omitted). The Court has “an independent obligation to ensure that extraordinary circumstances support such a request by balancing the party's stated interest in anonymity against the public's interest in openness and any prejudice that anonymity would post to the opposing party.” Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 274; Doe, 85 F.4th at 211.
III. ANALYSIS
In applying the James v. Jacobson factors to this case, the Court finds they weigh in favor of permitting anonymity.
As to the first James factor, Plaintiff submits that she seeks to proceed anonymously not to avoid annoyance and criticism, but rather “to preserve the privacy of her medical information and its inextricable association with her identity resulting in this very civil action.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's Complaint does not sufficiently describe that the medical information at issue “is of a highly personal and sensitive nature” so as to warrant anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp., ECF No. 11 at 5-6. The Court disagrees. The Complaint makes clear that Plaintiff sought an appointment with the CARM and that she did so because she was experiencing difficulty becoming pregnant. See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 10. It further alleges that Defendant's employees disclosed confidential medical information relating to Plaintiff seeking care from CARM. Id. at ¶ 28 (“The Defendant, by and through its agents and employees, publicly disclosed Plaintiff Doe's private diagnosis and/or information involving her having scheduled treatment at its fertility center.”). Medical information regarding fertility issues is surely highly personal and sensitive in nature. This factor weighs heavily in favor of permitting anonymity.
As to the second James factor, the risk of retaliatory or mental harm to the party seeking anonymity, Plaintiff asserts that requiring her “to identify herself as [she] seeks to vindicate her privacy rights will cause her unnecessary mental harm by causing the public to learn of the matters she reasonably expected the Defendant would keep private.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. The Court agrees. This is not a case where disclosure of medical information is ancillary to a plaintiff's claim. See Def.'s Resp. in Opp. at 7, ECF No. 11. Instead, Plaintiff seeks vindication for the Defendant's alleged violation of her privacy rights through the disclosure of her medical information. Requiring Plaintiff to name herself will necessarily inform the public of the medical information she wished to remain private, exacerbating the harm Plaintiff claims to have suffered.This factor weighs in favor of anonymity.
The Court is not swayed by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff will not suffer harm from further disclosure of her medical information because she is not a resident of Cabell County, West Virginia. The Court's public docket is just that, public. Plaintiff's Complaint is accessible to individuals outside of this judicial district. Def.'s Resp. in Opp. at 8.
Regarding the third James factor, the age of the person whose privacy interests are sought to be protected, Plaintiff concedes that she is not a minor but offers that “this factor neither favors [n]or discourages her proceeding anonymously.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. While a minor plaintiff has a greater degree of interest in proceeding anonymously, see Def.'s Resp. in Opp. 8, the Court finds age to be a neutral factor in deciding whether Plaintiff should be permitted to proceed under a pseudonym. See Doe v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., & State Univ., No. 7:21-CV-378, 2022 WL 972629, at *3 (W.D. Va. Mar. 30, 2022).
As to the fourth James factor, whether the action is against a governmental or private party, Because Plaintiff's case is against a private party, Defendant submits this factor weighs against anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp. 9 (citing, for example, Doe v. Alger, 317 F.R.D 37 (W.D. Va. 2016)). The Court agrees and weighs this factor against granting anonymity. See Doe, 85 F.4th at 216.
Finally, the fifth James factor assesses the risk of unfairness that allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will cause Defendant. Here, Plaintiff has offered to provide her name to the Defendant under a protective order. Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3-4. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that it is inherently unfair for Plaintiff to be permitted to proceed pseudonymously while it has been publicly named. That unfairness surely exists in almost every case where a plaintiff seeks anonymity. The Court has not, however, been apprised of specific circumstances that would make allowing this plaintiff to proceed anonymously particularly unfair to Defendant. Defendant has not suggested that anonymity will cause difficulty during discovery, see Doe 85 F.4th at 216, or that Defendant will suffer other identifiable unfairness in this litigation. The Court finds this factor does not weigh against anonymity.
On balance, the Court finds that these factors weigh in favor of anonymity. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff's interest in anonymity outweighs the public's interest in open judicial proceedings. See Doe, 85 F.4th at 211.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's case does not present any extraordinary circumstances to support her request for anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp., ECF No. 11. The Court disagrees. This is not a case where sensitive medical records or information simply may become relevant in the course of discovery; Plaintiff's Complaint arises solely from Defendant's alleged unlawful disclosure of information related to Plaintiff seeking care from Defendant relating to her difficulty becoming pregnant and desire for care at Defendant's fertility center.
Seeking anonymity in this case does not strike the Court as a mere attempt “to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend . . . litigation,” Jacobson, 6 F.3d at 238, but rather as Plaintiff's only opportunity to seek a remedy for her alleged injury without greater public disclosure of her confidential information. On the other hand, the public has no specific or identifiable interest in Plaintiff's medical information. The Court accordingly finds Plaintiff's interest in anonymity “outweighs the public in openness and any prejudice that anonymity would pose to the opposing party.” See Doe, 85 F.4th at 211; Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 274 (noting that “the use of a fictitious name has been permitted in cases involving the disclosure of confidential information”).
IV. CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff's Motion, ECF No. 2, is GRANTED. Plaintiff is permitted to proceed in this litigation anonymously.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties.

Woman says St. Mary’s didn't protect her medical records

By Kyla Asbury
Jan 20, 2016
HUNTINGTON – A Wayne County woman is suing St. Mary’s Medical Center after she claims it allowed people to access her private health information that should not have had access.
St. Mary’s Medical Management LLC; Cabell-Huntington Hospital Inc.; Rebecca Winters, formerly known as Rebecca Harmon; and Jessica Hatfield also were named as defendants in the suit.
On Oct. 25, 2013, C.H. went to her physician Dr. Joseph P. Assaley, for certain laboratory tests, which included testing for sexually transmitted diseases, according to a complaint filed in Cabell Circuit Court.
C.H. claims the laboratory generated a medical record documenting the results of the testing, which was housed in its Sorian document management system. Sometime prior to December 2013, St. Mary’s and Cabell’s document management system merged.
The plaintiff did not disclose the results of her laboratory testing to anyone and on Dec. 17, 2013, Winters obtained access to and viewed her protected health information. On that same day, Hatfield also obtained access and viewed her PHI.
On Dec. 19, 2013, Hatfield against obtained access to and viewed C.H.’s patient care summary and lab results from her PHI, according to the suit.
C.H. claims Winters obtained a copy of her testing results, altered the results to indicate that she tested positive for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea and then published the falsified results to multiple third-parties.
On Jan. 20, 2014, Winters again obtained access to and viewed C.H.’s confidential medical records and continued to publish not only the very private facts that C.H. had been tested for STDs, but additionally, the falsified results of the testing, seeking out and telling anyone who would listen that she had Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, according to the suit.
C.H. claims she began to see Internet posts alleging she had various STDs, and complaints were made to her employer alleging she had STDs and she began receiving insulting and intrusive prank phone calls from untraceable numbers.
Once she realized the calls were not dying down and the incident did not simply blow over, she reached out to Assaley about the apparent disclosure and dissemination of her PHI, according to the suit.
C.H. claims in August 2014, she spoke to Cabell Huntington Hospital’s privacy officer, Sue Surritt, about the apparent access and disclosure of her medical records and in March, Surritt requested C.H.’s permission to disclose and discuss with St. Mary’s, the allegations regarding access and dissemination of her medical records by employees.
Kathy Jackson, St. Mary’s Medical Center’s Health Information Management Director and Privacy Officer did not perform an audit of her system or any type of investigation into the matter, as she believed the issue was Cabell’s problem, according to the suit.
C.H. claims the defendants actions were negligent and caused her emotional distress.
The defendants’ actions were willful, wanton, malicious and/or undertaken with reckless disregard and/or reckless indifference to the rights of the plaintiff, according to the suit.
C.H. is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is being represented by Robert B. Warner, Lynnette Simon Marshall and Andrew D. Byrd of Warner Law Offices PLLC; and Jack C. Dolance of the Law Office of Jack C. Dolance PLLC.
The case is assigned to Circuit Judge Christopher D. Chiles.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

Detroit woman says hospital employees improperly accessed her medical records
FEDERAL COURT

By Kyla Asbury
Sep 11, 2023
HUNTINGTON —An unnamed woman from Detroit is suing Cabell Huntington Hospital for improper and unauthorized access to her medical records.
Jane Doe scheduled an appointment with Cabell's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine for Oct. 10, 2022. She was unable to make her scheduled appointment, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
At all times before the defendant's alleged breach of her privacy, the plaintiff had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.
"On or about November 8, 2022, plaintiff learned from a former employee that two employees of defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same," the complaint states. "Defendant’s improper dissemination of plaintiff's medical information has caused her unnecessary embarrassment. It has also exacerbated her anxiety."
The plaintiff did not permit the defendant or its agents to communicate or otherwise divulge any of her medical information to any third parties, according to the suit.
Doe claims as a result of the improper and illegal dissemination of her medical information to unauthorized persons, she has suffered damages and seeks complete justice.
Doe claims as a provider of health care services, the defendant owes a legal duty to ensure, protect and maintain the privacy and confidential medical and health care information of all persons whom it serves and treats.
At all times mentioned, the defendant knew or should have known that its employees, including the ones who improperly divulged Doe’s information, could and unfortunately, would improperly divulge a patient’s private medical information in course of and scope of their employments in the absence of proper security/protection/training measures taken by the defendant.
"As a provider of health care services, defendant has a duty to train all its employees having access to and/or information about a patient’s medical information on the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality," the complaint states. "Defendant’s employees, including the employee who improperly divulged Ms. Doe’s medical status, have a duty to comply with defendant’s privacy policies and promptly abide by and enforce them."
Doe claims the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to ensure that its employees cannot disseminate private medical information to unauthorized third parties who have no need for such confidential information.
Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Hoyt Glazer of Glazer Saad Anderson in Huntington.

JANE DOE, Plaintiff, v. CABELL HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL, INC., Defendant.
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
ROBERT C. CHAMBERS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Pending is Plaintiff Jane Doe's Motion to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 2), filed June 15, 2023. Defendant Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. filed a response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion (ECF No. 11) on August 7, 2023, and Plaintiff filed a reply memorandum on August 21, 2023 (ECF No. 14).
For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED.
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that in August 2022 Plaintiff scheduled an appointment with Defendant Cabell Huntington Hospital's Center for Advanced Reproductive Medicine (“CARM”) for October 10, 2022. Compl. ¶ 8. Plaintiff was ultimately unable to attend her appointment. Id. at ¶ 9.
On or about November 8, 2022, Plaintiff alleges that she learned “that two employees of Defendant had repeatedly accessed her file and shared Plaintiff's private information with third parties or individuals having no need to receive the same.” Id. at ¶ 11. Plaintiff did not give the Defendant or its agents permission to share her confidential medical information. Id. at ¶ 13.
In fact, at the time of Defendant's alleged disclosure of her information Plaintiff “had not disclosed that she was experiencing difficulties becoming pregnant, and had not shared such information with family, much less the public.” Id. at ¶ 10.
As a result of this unauthorized disclosure of her medical information, Plaintiff alleges that she has suffered “unnecessary embarrassment” and exacerbated anxiety. Id. at ¶ 12.
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See id. at ¶¶ 6-7. The Complaint asserts two causes of action against Defendant: (I) negligent training, supervision, and retention; and (II) invasion of privacy.
Plaintiff now asks the Court to allow her to proceed in this litigation anonymously. Defendant has responded in opposition.
II. LEGAL STANDARD
Generally, a civil complaint “must name all the parties” to the action. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 10(a). This “rule recognizes ‘the general presumption of openness of judicial proceedings,' which has a basis both in common law and in the First Amendment.” Doe v. Doe, 85 F.4th 206, 210 (4th Cir. 2023). The Fourth Circuit has expounded that “‘[p]seudonymous litigation undermines the public undermines the public's right of access to judicial proceedings' because ‘[t]he public has an interest in knowing the names of litigants, and disclosing the parties' identities furthers openness of judicial proceedings.'” Id. at 210-11 (quoting Doe v. Public Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 274 (4th Cir. 2014)) (alterations in original).
As this Court previously has stated, whether a party should be permitted to proceed anonymously rests in “‘the sound discretion of the district court.'” W. M. v. Braskem Am., Inc., No. 3:20-CV-00141, 2020 WL 1492544, at *1 (S.D. W.Va. Mar. 26, 2020) (quoting Doe v. Alger, 317 F.R.D. 37, 39 (W.D. Va. 2016)). This has recently been affirmed by the Fourth Circuit. Doe, 85 F.4th at 210.
In making an anonymity decision, the Court considers the five factors set forth by the Fourth Circuit in James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233 (4th Cir. 1993). These factors are:
[1] whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; [2] whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the requesting party or even more critically, to innocent non-parties; [3] the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; [4] whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and [5] the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously.
6 F.3d at 238 (citations omitted). The Court has “an independent obligation to ensure that extraordinary circumstances support such a request by balancing the party's stated interest in anonymity against the public's interest in openness and any prejudice that anonymity would post to the opposing party.” Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 274; Doe, 85 F.4th at 211.
III. ANALYSIS
In applying the James v. Jacobson factors to this case, the Court finds they weigh in favor of permitting anonymity.
As to the first James factor, Plaintiff submits that she seeks to proceed anonymously not to avoid annoyance and criticism, but rather “to preserve the privacy of her medical information and its inextricable association with her identity resulting in this very civil action.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's Complaint does not sufficiently describe that the medical information at issue “is of a highly personal and sensitive nature” so as to warrant anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp., ECF No. 11 at 5-6. The Court disagrees. The Complaint makes clear that Plaintiff sought an appointment with the CARM and that she did so because she was experiencing difficulty becoming pregnant. See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 10. It further alleges that Defendant's employees disclosed confidential medical information relating to Plaintiff seeking care from CARM. Id. at ¶ 28 (“The Defendant, by and through its agents and employees, publicly disclosed Plaintiff Doe's private diagnosis and/or information involving her having scheduled treatment at its fertility center.”). Medical information regarding fertility issues is surely highly personal and sensitive in nature. This factor weighs heavily in favor of permitting anonymity.
As to the second James factor, the risk of retaliatory or mental harm to the party seeking anonymity, Plaintiff asserts that requiring her “to identify herself as [she] seeks to vindicate her privacy rights will cause her unnecessary mental harm by causing the public to learn of the matters she reasonably expected the Defendant would keep private.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. The Court agrees. This is not a case where disclosure of medical information is ancillary to a plaintiff's claim. See Def.'s Resp. in Opp. at 7, ECF No. 11. Instead, Plaintiff seeks vindication for the Defendant's alleged violation of her privacy rights through the disclosure of her medical information. Requiring Plaintiff to name herself will necessarily inform the public of the medical information she wished to remain private, exacerbating the harm Plaintiff claims to have suffered.This factor weighs in favor of anonymity.
The Court is not swayed by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff will not suffer harm from further disclosure of her medical information because she is not a resident of Cabell County, West Virginia. The Court's public docket is just that, public. Plaintiff's Complaint is accessible to individuals outside of this judicial district. Def.'s Resp. in Opp. at 8.
Regarding the third James factor, the age of the person whose privacy interests are sought to be protected, Plaintiff concedes that she is not a minor but offers that “this factor neither favors [n]or discourages her proceeding anonymously.” Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3. While a minor plaintiff has a greater degree of interest in proceeding anonymously, see Def.'s Resp. in Opp. 8, the Court finds age to be a neutral factor in deciding whether Plaintiff should be permitted to proceed under a pseudonym. See Doe v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., & State Univ., No. 7:21-CV-378, 2022 WL 972629, at *3 (W.D. Va. Mar. 30, 2022).
As to the fourth James factor, whether the action is against a governmental or private party, Because Plaintiff's case is against a private party, Defendant submits this factor weighs against anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp. 9 (citing, for example, Doe v. Alger, 317 F.R.D 37 (W.D. Va. 2016)). The Court agrees and weighs this factor against granting anonymity. See Doe, 85 F.4th at 216.
Finally, the fifth James factor assesses the risk of unfairness that allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will cause Defendant. Here, Plaintiff has offered to provide her name to the Defendant under a protective order. Mot. to Proceed Anonymously at 3-4. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that it is inherently unfair for Plaintiff to be permitted to proceed pseudonymously while it has been publicly named. That unfairness surely exists in almost every case where a plaintiff seeks anonymity. The Court has not, however, been apprised of specific circumstances that would make allowing this plaintiff to proceed anonymously particularly unfair to Defendant. Defendant has not suggested that anonymity will cause difficulty during discovery, see Doe 85 F.4th at 216, or that Defendant will suffer other identifiable unfairness in this litigation. The Court finds this factor does not weigh against anonymity.
On balance, the Court finds that these factors weigh in favor of anonymity. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff's interest in anonymity outweighs the public's interest in open judicial proceedings. See Doe, 85 F.4th at 211.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's case does not present any extraordinary circumstances to support her request for anonymity. Def.'s Resp. in Opp., ECF No. 11. The Court disagrees. This is not a case where sensitive medical records or information simply may become relevant in the course of discovery; Plaintiff's Complaint arises solely from Defendant's alleged unlawful disclosure of information related to Plaintiff seeking care from Defendant relating to her difficulty becoming pregnant and desire for care at Defendant's fertility center.
Seeking anonymity in this case does not strike the Court as a mere attempt “to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend . . . litigation,” Jacobson, 6 F.3d at 238, but rather as Plaintiff's only opportunity to seek a remedy for her alleged injury without greater public disclosure of her confidential information. On the other hand, the public has no specific or identifiable interest in Plaintiff's medical information. The Court accordingly finds Plaintiff's interest in anonymity “outweighs the public in openness and any prejudice that anonymity would pose to the opposing party.” See Doe, 85 F.4th at 211; Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d at 274 (noting that “the use of a fictitious name has been permitted in cases involving the disclosure of confidential information”).
IV. CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff's Motion, ECF No. 2, is GRANTED. Plaintiff is permitted to proceed in this litigation anonymously.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties.

Woman says St. Mary’s didn't protect her medical records

By Kyla Asbury
Jan 20, 2016
HUNTINGTON – A Wayne County woman is suing St. Mary’s Medical Center after she claims it allowed people to access her private health information that should not have had access.
St. Mary’s Medical Management LLC; Cabell-Huntington Hospital Inc.; Rebecca Winters, formerly known as Rebecca Harmon; and Jessica Hatfield also were named as defendants in the suit.
On Oct. 25, 2013, C.H. went to her physician Dr. Joseph P. Assaley, for certain laboratory tests, which included testing for sexually transmitted diseases, according to a complaint filed in Cabell Circuit Court.
C.H. claims the laboratory generated a medical record documenting the results of the testing, which was housed in its Sorian document management system. Sometime prior to December 2013, St. Mary’s and Cabell’s document management system merged.
The plaintiff did not disclose the results of her laboratory testing to anyone and on Dec. 17, 2013, Winters obtained access to and viewed her protected health information. On that same day, Hatfield also obtained access and viewed her PHI.
On Dec. 19, 2013, Hatfield against obtained access to and viewed C.H.’s patient care summary and lab results from her PHI, according to the suit.
C.H. claims Winters obtained a copy of her testing results, altered the results to indicate that she tested positive for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea and then published the falsified results to multiple third-parties.
On Jan. 20, 2014, Winters again obtained access to and viewed C.H.’s confidential medical records and continued to publish not only the very private facts that C.H. had been tested for STDs, but additionally, the falsified results of the testing, seeking out and telling anyone who would listen that she had Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, according to the suit.
C.H. claims she began to see Internet posts alleging she had various STDs, and complaints were made to her employer alleging she had STDs and she began receiving insulting and intrusive prank phone calls from untraceable numbers.
Once she realized the calls were not dying down and the incident did not simply blow over, she reached out to Assaley about the apparent disclosure and dissemination of her PHI, according to the suit.
C.H. claims in August 2014, she spoke to Cabell Huntington Hospital’s privacy officer, Sue Surritt, about the apparent access and disclosure of her medical records and in March, Surritt requested C.H.’s permission to disclose and discuss with St. Mary’s, the allegations regarding access and dissemination of her medical records by employees.
Kathy Jackson, St. Mary’s Medical Center’s Health Information Management Director and Privacy Officer did not perform an audit of her system or any type of investigation into the matter, as she believed the issue was Cabell’s problem, according to the suit.
C.H. claims the defendants actions were negligent and caused her emotional distress.
The defendants’ actions were willful, wanton, malicious and/or undertaken with reckless disregard and/or reckless indifference to the rights of the plaintiff, according to the suit.
C.H. is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is being represented by Robert B. Warner, Lynnette Simon Marshall and Andrew D. Byrd of Warner Law Offices PLLC; and Jack C. Dolance of the Law Office of Jack C. Dolance PLLC.
The case is assigned to Circuit Judge Christopher D. Chiles.

HUNTINGTON — A federal judge in Huntington granted preliminary approval of a nearly $5.7 million class action lawsuit settlement between Cabell Huntington Hospital and some of its retirees who accused the provider of reneging on health care benefit promises.
If the settlement is approved, it would provide payments of more than $18,860 to each of 211 non-union retirees who were told in 2021 that their health coverage with Cabell Huntington would be terminated, which is approximately $4 million of the total settlement. A high-risk fund of $500,000 would be established and the remaining amount of the settlement would be for service, administrative and attorneys’ fees.

Throughout the year we participate in health fairs, providing free health education for disease prevention and management, and maintaining a healthful lifestyle. We also hold over 30 free annual flu shot clinics throughout the community – providing an average of 2,500 flu shots annually.
Fentanyl Education Program
In response to the national fentanyl poisoning crisis, Huntington Health launched a free fentanyl education program for the community. Huntington-affiliated emergency department physician Ted Peck, MD, and clinical pharmacist specialist Evan Adintori, PharmD, BCPS, and its community outreach team are spearheading the program, which offers free seminars to parents at local schools, and to the public at community centers and libraries.
The seminars cover the dangers of fentanyl, the pervasiveness of the drug in the community and what to do if someone overdoses. They also provide information about Narcan, a nasal spray used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids. Training for administering Narcan for a fentanyl poisoning is offered as well.
If you are interested in hosting this seminar for your organization or school, please email: CommunityOutreach@huntingtonhealth.org

CHH RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONNECT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS
CHH receives federal funding to connect community organizations
Monday, March 28, 2022
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network (MHN), has received $267,000 in federal funding as part of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations omnibus package. The funding recently was announced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“The mission of Mountain Health Network is to improve the well-being of all we serve through understanding, respecting and meeting their health needs,” said Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP, CEO, MHN and president, CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC). “We are so grateful to Sen. Capito, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, and Congresswoman Carol Miller for their continued commitment to our community by supporting that mission.”
The hospital will use the funds to purchase software that will enable FaithHealth Appalachia and other community organizations to connect through a shared technology platform that enables them to send and receive electronic referrals to address people’s social needs and improve health across communities.
“From its beginnings, FaithHealth Appalachia has existed to be a conduit of transformation by connecting faith communities, social service organizations and medical facilities to improve the total health of our neighbors,” said Rory Chapman, executive director of FaithHealth Appalachia. “Too often, we hear about folks falling through the cracks, or not getting the help they need simply because they lack information. We want to ensure people get the right information, so they access the right door at the right time.”
The software platform, called Unite US, is a national technology infrastructure with a presence in West Virginia that standardizes how health and social care providers communicate and track outcomes together.
“Unite West Virginia, and the entire Unite US platform, will be incredible tools that will assist us in our mission of connection in the Huntington and greater Tri-State community,” Chapman said. “It will enable us to better streamline our efforts in getting people the help they need, when and where they need it most. We hope to further our mission to better bridge the gaps within our communities and see less people falling through the cracks.”
The software will allow MHN member hospitals to join other community organizations to address social determinants of health such as food insecurity, transportation and other issues that impede their ability to thrive.
Community and social organizations that would like to connect with FaithHealth Appalachia may contact Rory Chapman at rory.chapman@chhi.org or 304-416-2098.

CHH RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONNECT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS
CHH receives federal funding to connect community organizations
Monday, March 28, 2022
Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH), a member of Mountain Health Network (MHN), has received $267,000 in federal funding as part of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations omnibus package. The funding recently was announced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“The mission of Mountain Health Network is to improve the well-being of all we serve through understanding, respecting and meeting their health needs,” said Kevin Yingling, RPh, MD, FACP, CEO, MHN and president, CHH and St. Mary’s Medical Center (SMMC). “We are so grateful to Sen. Capito, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, and Congresswoman Carol Miller for their continued commitment to our community by supporting that mission.”
The hospital will use the funds to purchase software that will enable FaithHealth Appalachia and other community organizations to connect through a shared technology platform that enables them to send and receive electronic referrals to address people’s social needs and improve health across communities.
“From its beginnings, FaithHealth Appalachia has existed to be a conduit of transformation by connecting faith communities, social service organizations and medical facilities to improve the total health of our neighbors,” said Rory Chapman, executive director of FaithHealth Appalachia. “Too often, we hear about folks falling through the cracks, or not getting the help they need simply because they lack information. We want to ensure people get the right information, so they access the right door at the right time.”
The software platform, called Unite US, is a national technology infrastructure with a presence in West Virginia that standardizes how health and social care providers communicate and track outcomes together.
“Unite West Virginia, and the entire Unite US platform, will be incredible tools that will assist us in our mission of connection in the Huntington and greater Tri-State community,” Chapman said. “It will enable us to better streamline our efforts in getting people the help they need, when and where they need it most. We hope to further our mission to better bridge the gaps within our communities and see less people falling through the cracks.”
The software will allow MHN member hospitals to join other community organizations to address social determinants of health such as food insecurity, transportation and other issues that impede their ability to thrive.
Community and social organizations that would like to connect with FaithHealth Appalachia may contact Rory Chapman at rory.chapman@chhi.org or 304-416-2098.

2. **Highlight Key Findings**: For each section, highlight any particularly notable findings or standout points before listing the links.
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure that the formatting of all sections is consistent, including the use of bullet points and link styles.

### Specific Feedback

1. **Financial Information**
    - **Add Summary Header**: Include a few sentences summarizing the financial health and any notable financial news.
    - **Include Key Financial Metrics**: Mention specific financial health metrics if available from sources like Charity Navigator or annual reports.

2. **Key Decision Makers**
    - **Highlight Changes**: Clearly state any recent changes in leadership, such as Dr. Kevin Yingling’s announced retirement.
    - **Organize Current Leadership**: Present a more detailed list or table section summarizing the current key decision-makers and their roles.

3. **Labor Relations**
    - **Update on NLRB Cases**: Summarize any notable outcomes or ongoing issues from the NLRB cases.
    - **Recent Negotiations**: Highlight the resolution of recent labor negotiations.

4. **Recent Scandals**

### Additional Suggestions

- **Summary Table**: Consider adding a summary table at the end of the document to quickly reference the key points from each section.

### Example Adjustments in HTML
