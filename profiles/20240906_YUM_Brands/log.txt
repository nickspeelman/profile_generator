Susan: To gather information on YUM Brands, a strategic and systematic approach will ensure that all relevant details are included. Let's lay out a step-by-step plan:

1. **Identify Key Data Sources:** We should identify the main sources of information such as YUM Brands' official website, its LinkedIn profile, financial news outlets (Forbes, Bloomberg, Reuters), business databases (Hoovers, PrivCo), regulators' sites (SEC for financials), and social media channels including Twitter and Facebook for public sentiment and latest news.

2. **Financial Information:** The primary source of financial data should be the YUM Brand's annual reports, quarterly results, and SEC filings. We must summarize the company's revenue, profits, debt, market share, and key future investment plans. Financial news sites can add context and expert opinions.

3. **Key Decision Makers:** We should identify the senior leadership team and the Board of Directors. Their profiles can be found on the official website and perhaps more detailed view on their LinkedIn profiles. Any significant career achievements, possible conflicts of interest, or personal details that could act as leverage points can be noted.

4. **Labor Relations:** For information related to labor relations, we can track company news, lawsuits, strikes, or disputes involving YUM Brands. We can also review union websites, labor right's groups, and local news outlets.

5. **Recent Scandals:** Public news outlets, trade publications and social media monitoring can help identify any recent company controversies or scandals.

6. **Additional Leverage Points:** CSR initiatives, brand reputation, public sentiment, customer complaints, and environmental issues can provide more leverage points. In addition, examining the company's supply chain, major partnerships and sponsorships can provide additional details. 

Lastly, organizing the information in a coherent manner will be critical. The final research brief should be a digestible summary that tells a story about YUM Brands from a financial and labor relations perspective.

Remember to always cross verify information from multiple sources to ensure its credibility before using it in your report. 

This process can be labor-intensive and take several days or even a week to complete, but will provide a comprehensive view of YUM Brands.
Manny: Sure, here's a Python list of five search queries that Remi should perform:

```python
search_queries_for_remi = [
    "site:sec.gov YUM Brands annual report",
    "YUM Brands board of directors LinkedIn profiles",
    "YUM Brands labor disputes or strikes",
    "YUM Brands recent scandals or controversies",
