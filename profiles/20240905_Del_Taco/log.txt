Susan: Sure, here's a potential strategy to gather information on Del Taco:

1. **Company Information:** Begin by conducting basic research on Del Taco to gain an overall understanding of the company. Resources such as Google, Wikipedia, and Del Taco's official website are good places to start. Look for the company's mission statement, history and major initiatives. 

2. **Financial Information:** Gather financial information on Del Taco, this may require looking at financial news outlets like Forbes, Bloomberg, and CNBC. If Del Taco is a public company, review their latest 10-K and 10-Q report through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) EDGAR database to understand the company's financial health, competition, etc. 

3. **Key Decision Makers:** Identify key decision makers in Del Taco. LinkedIn can be an excellent source for this. Look for possible points of leverage by digging into these individuals' professional histories, affiliations, public statements, and media appearances. 

4. **Labour Relations:** Look for any news or reports regarding labour relations involving Del Taco. Check for any lawsuits or disputes between the company and its current or former employees. Websites like Indeed or Glassdoor can sometimes provide insider insights about working conditions within the company. Also check news articles or reports from labor rights organizations for any issues.

5. **Recent Scandals or Controversy:** Investigate any recent (or past) scandals, controversies, or legal issues involving Del Taco, its executives, products or practices. Look for news articles, reports from watchdog groups and even social media posts.

6. **International Influence:** If Del Taco has operations in other countries, investigate whether there is any information available regarding their practices in these locations, as it might provide additional points of leverage.

7. **Consumer Sentiment and Trends:** Understanding public opinion about Del Taco can be useful as well. This can be gauged by reading customer reviews on platforms like Yelp or Google Reviews. Also, look at the company's own social media feeds for customer sentiments and reactions.

8. **Competitors:** It could also be useful to understand who Del Taco's main competitors are, as this could identify potential weak points or strategies being used in the industry.

9. **Sustainability Practices:** As more consumers value ethics and sustainability, understanding Del Taco's stance on these issues could provide leverage points.

Once all this information is collated, it can be synthesized into a research brief, highlighting the key points of interest for the labor union. Always be sure to cite your sources and note down where each piece of information was found for future reference and verifiability.
