Susan: 1. **Company's Official Website and Financial Reports:** Begin by visiting General Motors' official website to understand their core values, mission, vision, and key projects. Check their investor relations page for annual reports, quarterly financial results, presentations and calls. This will provide the financial health of the company, major investments, risks, future plans etc.

2. **Key Decision Makers:** Look for the company's executive team page or check platforms like LinkedIn. This will include the CEO, CFO, heads of different departments. Once you have these names, do an individual web search for each person. Look for any past controversy, personal interests, pressure points and influencers that can work as leverage.

3. **Labor Relations:** Find news related to GM's human resource practices, labor issues, and employee concerns. Use labor and industrial relation platforms, union websites, HR and employment news portals. See if any pattern emerges like frequent strikes, reports of harassment or discrimination, low wages, or safety issues.

4. **Recent Scandals:** Look for any negative news or scandals involving GM. Venture across blogs, news portals, social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit), and online automotive forums- these often discuss recalls, defective units, lawsuits etc. You could look out for instances of corporate fraud, data breaches, controversial ads, product quality concerns, or unethical business practices.

5. **Regulatory Filings:** Researching U.S Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database could provide additional insights on financial data, debts, obligations, lawsuits, and potential risks. 

6. **Corporate Relationships:** Map GM's relations with other businesses or governments. Look for major suppliers, partners, sponsors, at country or city level who GM may be sensitive to.

7. **Social Responsibility Initiatives:** Understand GM’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. If the company prides in its CSR, this knowledge could provide another point of leverage. 

This is a proactive approach, and you should revisit these points every few months as situations change. Note, however, that leverage opportunities should be used legally and ethically.
