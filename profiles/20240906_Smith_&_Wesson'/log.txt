Susan: Researching a specific company like Smith & Wesson can be broken down into a few key steps:

1. **Identify Key Information Needs**: For our purpose, we need to find information related to financial data, key decision-makers, labor relations, and recent scandals or newsworthy incidents. 

2. **Identify Reliable Sources of Information**: To gather accurate information, you should use reliable online platforms. These might include:
   - **Financial Information**: Websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Bloomberg can provide detailed financial information. 
   - **Decision Makers**: LinkedIn can help identify key people working within the company, their backgrounds, roles, and connections. Company's website, especially the 'about us' or 'team' section is another source.
   - **Labor Relations & Scandals**: Online news publications like The New York Times, Washington Post, or BBC can provide recent articles related to the company. Web search for specific news on labor relations or scandals using Google News.
   - **Company Reports & Filings**: Public companies' websites will often have a "for investors" or similar page where they publish annual reports, quarterly filings with the SEC (10-K and 10-Q), and press releases. 

3. **Information Gathering and Validation**: Start searching these reliable sources to collect the necessary information. For unbiased results, ensure to cross-check the information from multiple sources. 

4. **Analyze & Prepare Briefs**: After gathering the information, analyze it to identify points of leverage over decision-makers, financial stability, labor relations, etc. Then prepare briefs summarizing all this information.

In all your research, approach with an open mind and leave no stone unturned for potential leads or information. Always conform to ethical guidelines and norms in your research methodologies. Remember to validate the information from multiple sources to ensure its accuracy.

Why Smith & Wesson (SWBI) Shares Are Plunging Today
Shares of american firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) fell 10.3% in the morning session after the company reported second-quarter earnings results. Its revenue and EPS unfortunately fell short of Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue fell 23% y/y as demand for firearms was softer than expected despite the anticipated seasonal summer deceleration. Encouragingly, management noted that demand picked up in August. Overall, this was a weaker quarter.

Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Overall firearms demand during our first fiscal quarter was softer than we anticipated, but our results once again proved the resiliency of our flexible manufacturing model, which allows us to adapt quickly to any market conditions and still deliver on bottom-line profitability targets. Importantly, while the usual summer seasonality was more pronounced this year, demand has already begun to rebound as we enter the busy fall season. We have also been pleased with the response to the launch of our next generation Bodyguard 2.0 conceal carry pistol late in the first quarter, which is already outperforming expectations. As we look forward to new capacity coming online for our popular new products, a strong pipeline of innovation, and the typically busy firearm demand season now upon us, we expect to more than offset these temporary headwinds during the balance of the fiscal year, and continue to expect top- and bottom-line growth for the full year."
Deana McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Demand during the summer was slower than we expected, but we started to see an increase in orders in August. We expect our second fiscal quarter sales to grow significantly over the first quarter and we remain confident that our full year revenue will be up mid-to-high single digits compared to fiscal 2024. Our board of directors has approved a new $50 million share repurchase program that positions us to opportunistically repurchase shares for another twelve months. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our board of directors has authorized a $0.13 per share quarterly dividend, which will be paid to stockholders of record on September 19, 2024 with payment to be made on October 3, 2024."
Conference Call and Webcast
The company will host a conference call and webcast on September 5, 2024 to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2025 financial and operational results. Speakers on the conference call will include Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Deana McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The conference call may include forward-looking statements. The conference call and webcast will begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time). Interested parties in North America are invited to participate by dialing 1-877-704-4453. Interested parties from outside North America are invited to participate by dialing 1-201-389-0920. Participants should dial in at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the call. The conference call audio webcast can also be accessed live on the company's website at www.smith-wesson.com, under the Investor Relations section.
Additional Details about the New Stock Repurchase Program
Our board of directors has approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which purchases may be made from September 20, 2024 through September 20, 2025. The amount and timing of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. The repurchases may be made on the open market, in block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions. Any shares of common stock repurchased under the program will be considered issued but not outstanding shares of the company's common stock.
Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures, including "non-GAAP net income," "Adjusted EBITDAS," and "free cash flow" are presented. From time-to-time, we consider and use these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. We believe it is useful for us and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) spin related stock-based compensation, (vi) Relocation expense, and (vii) the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. We present these non-GAAP measures because we consider them an important supplemental measure of our performance. Our definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. We believe these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP measures. The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect our actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its financial measures on a GAAP basis.

Why Smith & Wesson (SWBI) Shares Are Plunging Today
Shares of american firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) fell 10.3% in the morning session after the company reported second-quarter earnings results. Its revenue and EPS unfortunately fell short of Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue fell 23% y/y as demand for firearms was softer than expected despite the anticipated seasonal summer deceleration. Encouragingly, management noted that demand picked up in August. Overall, this was a weaker quarter.

Notably, revenue fell 23% y/y as demand for firearms was softer than expected despite the anticipated seasonal summer deceleration. Encouragingly, management noted that demand picked up in August. Overall, this was a weaker quarter.

- Board of Directors Authorized New $50 Million Stock Repurchase Program
Maryville, Tennessee--(Newsfile Corp. - September 5, 2024) - Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWBI), a U.S.-based leader in firearm manufacturing and design, today announced financial results for the first quarter fiscal 2025, ended July 31, 2024.
First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Highlights
Net sales were $88.3 million, a decrease of $25.9 million, or 22.7%, from the comparable quarter last year.
Gross margin was 27.4% compared with 26.6% in the comparable quarter last year.
GAAP net loss was $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, compared with net income of $3.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year.
Non-GAAP net loss was $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $6.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for income include costs related to the relocation. For a detailed reconciliation, see the schedules that follow in this release.
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDAS was $9.9 million, or 11.2% of net sales, compared with $17.5 million, or 15.3% of net sales, for the comparable quarter last year.
Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Overall firearms demand during our first fiscal quarter was softer than we anticipated, but our results once again proved the resiliency of our flexible manufacturing model, which allows us to adapt quickly to any market conditions and still deliver on bottom-line profitability targets. Importantly, while the usual summer seasonality was more pronounced this year, demand has already begun to rebound as we enter the busy fall season. We have also been pleased with the response to the launch of our next generation Bodyguard 2.0 conceal carry pistol late in the first quarter, which is already outperforming expectations. As we look forward to new capacity coming online for our popular new products, a strong pipeline of innovation, and the typically busy firearm demand season now upon us, we expect to more than offset these temporary headwinds during the balance of the fiscal year, and continue to expect top- and bottom-line growth for the full year."
Deana McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Demand during the summer was slower than we expected, but we started to see an increase in orders in August. We expect our second fiscal quarter sales to grow significantly over the first quarter and we remain confident that our full year revenue will be up mid-to-high single digits compared to fiscal 2024. Our board of directors has approved a new $50 million share repurchase program that positions us to opportunistically repurchase shares for another twelve months. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, our board of directors has authorized a $0.13 per share quarterly dividend, which will be paid to stockholders of record on September 19, 2024 with payment to be made on October 3, 2024."
Conference Call and Webcast
The company will host a conference call and webcast on September 5, 2024 to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2025 financial and operational results. Speakers on the conference call will include Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Deana McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The conference call may include forward-looking statements. The conference call and webcast will begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time). Interested parties in North America are invited to participate by dialing 1-877-704-4453. Interested parties from outside North America are invited to participate by dialing 1-201-389-0920. Participants should dial in at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the call. The conference call audio webcast can also be accessed live on the company's website at www.smith-wesson.com, under the Investor Relations section.
Additional Details about the New Stock Repurchase Program
Our board of directors has approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which purchases may be made from September 20, 2024 through September 20, 2025. The amount and timing of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. The repurchases may be made on the open market, in block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions. Any shares of common stock repurchased under the program will be considered issued but not outstanding shares of the company's common stock.
Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures, including "non-GAAP net income," "Adjusted EBITDAS," and "free cash flow" are presented. From time-to-time, we consider and use these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. We believe it is useful for us and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) spin related stock-based compensation, (vi) Relocation expense, and (vii) the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. We present these non-GAAP measures because we consider them an important supplemental measure of our performance. Our definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. We believe these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP measures. The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect our actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its financial measures on a GAAP basis.

Its revenue and EPS unfortunately fell short of Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue fell 23% y/y as demand for firearms was softer than expected despite the anticipated seasonal summer deceleration. Encouragingly, management noted that demand picked up in August. Overall, this was a weaker quarter.

The Most Important Gun Lawsuit You’ve Never Heard Of
A case in New Jersey about Smith & Wesson’s advertising could expose secrets that the industry would prefer to keep hidden.

Published March 2, 2021
Updated Nov. 3, 2021
She places her gun in a red leather handbag and gets into her car. The gun, in her bag, sits in the front seat of the vehicle as she drives to work. She then brings the gun, still in the bag, to a meeting with colleagues at the office. She then takes the gun, in her bag, to lunch, where she sits at an outdoor cafe. After that, she goes to the gym — and the gun comes with her. Finally, she goes to a shooting range, where she takes the gun out and fires it at a target. “Nice pistol,” says the man next to her.
That’s the plot of a television commercial for Smith & Wesson.
However, almost everything in the ad would be illegal in at least 35 states if the woman did not have a concealed carry permit, which the ad ignores.
A largely overlooked lawsuit is playing out in New Jersey about the way Smith & Wesson advertises its wares, but the truth is the case is about much more than advertising. The outcome could have profound implications for the gun industry.
In business and policy circles, and within the gun industry itself, the case is seen as the country’s most consequential legal battle over the future of gun control.

At a time when big companies have taken a stand against gun violence — the influential Business Roundtable lobby group has called on Congress to enact stricter laws — corporate America is watching closely.
Gun manufacturers have long been immune from liability for gun crimes and deaths because of federal laws that protect them. As a result, virtually no one has been able to mount a legal case that would allow for access to records from inside a gun manufacturer, be it internal emails, memos, notes or other material showing what gun industry executives say behind closed doors about the products they make.
But Phil Murphy, the Democratic governor of New Jersey — a longtime gun control advocate — decided to do something novel: In October, his attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, sent a subpoena to Smith & Wesson from the state’s division of consumer affairs as part of an investigation into advertising fraud, seeking a trove of internal documents. No industry has any particular immunity from cases about the claims it makes in advertising.

In truth, the subpoena is a Trojan horse to expose publicly, for the first time, the inner workings of the gun industry.

“The gun industry is afraid of nothing more than the ability of the public to see behind the scenes and to see their internal documents and to have their executives sit down and face the music,” said J. Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The case has the potential to put a spotlight on the inner workings of gun manufacturers similar to the tobacco industry in the 1990s.
“Public opinion turned so dramatically against the tobacco companies when it became clear that executives knew the truth about their products and were lying to the public,” Mr. Skaggs said. “The gun industry fears the same thing.”
The industry has been trying to avoid a moment like this for years. Just as a court was about to rule in a lawsuit against Remington brought by the families of children killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, the company filed for bankruptcy, delaying the case. The National Rifle Association declared bankruptcy this year in an effort to end an investigation by the New York attorney general.

In December, Smith & Wesson sued the State of New Jersey in federal court seeking to enjoin the state court from enforcing the subpoena.
The company argued that the case wasn’t about advertising. “In reality, it seeks to suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda that the attorney general publicly committed to pursue,” Smith & Wesson said in its filing.
It suggested that officials in New Jersey sought “to bypass the legislative ‘process’ and engage in abusive litigation, along with investigatory and other tactics, to create sufficient ‘pressure’ to compel Smith & Wesson to ‘voluntarily’ adopt ‘reforms’ consistent with the activists’ gun control agenda.”
In a motion to dismiss the suit last month, Mr. Grewal argued that Smith & Wesson “attempts to turn a garden-variety state consumer-fraud investigation into a federal constitutional case.” The state’s consumer affairs division, “like similar state consumer agencies all across the country,” the filing noted, “regularly initiates investigations and enforcement actions to protect consumers from unlawful business practices involving a range of goods and services.”
Let’s call New Jersey’s reply what it is: disingenuous. The court knows — and clearly Smith & Wesson knows — that the advertising fraud investigation is not “garden-variety” anything.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the motive of the investigation, for the purposes of the law, is beside the point. The case will rest on whether Smith & Wesson breached state laws that prevent companies from misleading customers.
And that’s where New Jersey’s case is particularly clever.
Specifically, Smith & Wesson claims that its advertising is protected by the Second Amendment and the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was enacted in 2005 to prevent frivolous suits against the gun industry.
But as New Jersey argued, the law excludes “an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.” In other words, an investigation into gun advertising is fair game.
Whether a subpoena will ultimately turn up emails and notes from gun executives discussing their role in the gun violence that has engulfed the country is anyone’s guess. But if history is a guide, when thousands of internal documents are exposed there is often unflattering material. And when the industry in question has long felt protected by special laws, it’s possible that the material could be particularly revealing.
Whatever the case, we may finally be able to see it.

Smith & Wesson’s Owner to Break Away From Gun Business
The move separates the broader company from the challenges the gun industry faces. It was announced shortly before another mass shooting.

The gun-maker Smith & Wesson was once an iconic national brand, a symbol of Americana and rugged individualism dating back to the battlefields of the Civil War.
But over the last two years, Smith & Wesson’s parent company, American Outdoor Brands, has seen its stock price plunge as public and investor pressure to curb gun violence has grown.
Late Wednesday, the company said it was spinning off its firearms unit, insulating the broader business from the challenges facing the gun industry.
The decision was motivated by “significant changes in the political climate as well as the economic, investing and insurance markets,” Barry M. Monheit, chairman of American Outdoor Brands, said in a statement.

Less than a day after the announcement, a shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita, Calif., left two students dead and three wounded.
Timothy D. Lytton, an expert on the firearm industry at Georgia State University, said the violence of the last few years had drawn “a lot of unwanted attention” to Smith & Wesson, whose firearms have been used in several mass shootings.
“A national brand that is involved in a lot of different sectors wants to provide some measure of distance between itself and a company that has been repeatedly associated with high-profile shootings,” Mr. Lytton said.
A shift in public opinion polls in favor of more gun control has influenced retailers across the United States, especially after back-to-back shootings this summer in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.
In September, Walmart said it would stop selling ammunition that could be used in military-style assault rifles like the one fired by a gunman in one of its stores in El Paso.

The next month, Dick’s Sporting Goods, which has grappled publicly with its ties to the gun industry, said it had destroyed more than $5 million worth of military-style, semiautomatic rifles. Its chief executive, Ed Stack, has said the company is considering whether it will continue to sell guns.
Rising consumer outrage is not the only issue facing companies like American Outdoor Brands. Some families of mass shooting victims have sued retailers and gunmakers in an attempt to make them accountable. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court allowed relatives of shooting victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., to move forward with a lawsuit against Remington Arms, the maker of the rifle used in the 2012 massacre.
A drawn-out legal fight and the headlines that would come with it are “something the parent company probably wants to avoid,” said Mr. Lytton, the gun expert at Georgia State. “By splitting Smith & Wesson off, they’re more likely to insulate themselves from that litigation and reputational damage.”
Separating from Smith & Wesson may also simply be a smart business decision for American Outdoor Brands: Sales from its firearms segment have fallen 38 percent since 2017.
That drop has come during a broader downswing for the industry since the 2016 presidential election, as gun owners have become less worried about the prospect that the government might seize their weapons.

Gun-makers tend to enjoy their greatest success when political forces seem to be arrayed against the industry, said Allen Rostron, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.
“People being upset about gun violence isn’t going to put a gun company out of business,” Mr. Rostron said. “The people who are going to protest and boycott — they’re not buying guns.”
Under the restructuring, which will go into effect next year, American Outdoor Brands will focus on its outdoor equipment business, like Hooyman tree saws and Bubba fishing gear, the company said. Smith & Wesson Brands will become a separate, publicly traded company.
In recent years, other gunmakers have also responded to the changing economic climate. Remington sought bankruptcy protection in March 2018 after sales fell and its debt piled up. In September, Colt said it would suspend production of sporting rifles, including its signature AR-15, for the civilian market, citing market conditions.
Wall Street has also started to rethink its close ties with gun-makers.
Last year, Citigroup said it would require business customers to restrict certain firearms sales, while Bank of America said it would stop lending to manufacturers of military-inspired firearms for civilian use. Other companies, like the investment management firm BlackRock, have asked firearms companies for details about their business practices.

American Outdoor Brands is not the first major outdoors company to spin off its firearms business. After the fatal 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., which involved an AR-15 rifle, REI suspended orders of bike helmets and water bottles made by Vista Outdoor, protesting the company’s production of assault-style firearms.
Two months later, Vista Outdoor announced that it would sell its gun-making business.
The AR-15 used in Parkland, however, was made by Smith & Wesson, whose products have been implicated in several other high-profile shootings. A 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun was used in the attack on YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., in 2018. One of the firearms owned by the gunman who attacked a Colorado movie theater in 2012 was made by Smith & Wesson.
And in February, a fired employee returned to a suburban Chicago factory with a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun with a laser sight, which the authorities said he used to kill five of his former co-workers.
Since its founding in the 1850s, Smith & Wesson has long occupied a singular place in the public imagination, associated with the Civil War and the exploration of the American West. But it has also faced decades of backlash from gun-control advocates. In 2000, Smith & Wesson was nearly put out of business when gun owners boycotted it after it agreed to marketing and design regulations proposed by the Clinton administration.

After the restructuring, Mark Smith, the president of the manufacturing services division at American Outdoor Brands, will take up the role of chief executive at Smith & Wesson Brands.

Nuns Who Own Shares of Smith & Wesson Sue Over AR-15 Deaths
A coalition of Catholic nuns claim that the gun maker is putting itself at risk by selling the AR-15-style rifles. The company’s C.E.O. called it a “frivolous lawsuit.”

Dec. 7, 2023
A coalition of four Catholic nun congregations said in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday that the gun maker Smith & Wesson has put shareholders at risk in the way it makes, markets and sells its AR-15-style rifle.
The nuns, who are Smith & Wesson shareholders, argue that the gun maker is exposing itself to liability by intentionally violating laws in its production and sale of the rifles, which have been used in several high-profile mass shootings.
The lawsuit, filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nev., states that Smith & Wesson “has enjoyed with abandon the record-breaking profits from its sale of AR-15 rifles, seemingly unfazed by the exponential rise in gun deaths and mass shootings carried out with its product in the United States.”
The nuns are from Adrian Dominican Sisters in Adrian, Mich.; the Sisters of Bon Secours USA in Marriottsville, Md.; the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia in Aston, Pa.; and the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, U.S.-Ontario Province in Marylhurst, Ore.

Mark Smith, the chief executive and president of Smith & Wesson, said in a statement that the nuns were “not interested in the best interests of the company or its stockholders.”
He added, “This frivolous lawsuit is simply another instance in their long history of attempting to hijack and abuse the shareholder advocacy process to harm our reputation and company.”
Earlier this year, the nuns sponsored a resolution to have Smith & Wesson conduct an assessment of the human rights impact of its business practices, but a majority of shareholders voted against it in September.
The nuns’ action this week is a derivative lawsuit, a legal mechanism that allows shareholders to sue the leaders of a company for breaching their duties.
Jeffrey Norton, the lead lawyer for the nuns’ coalition, said on Thursday that his clients collectively owned more than 1,000 shares of Smith & Wesson.

Jennifer Wu, a clinical assistant professor of finance at the University at Buffalo School of Management, said that 1,000 shares was a “very, very small” amount of the 46 million outstanding shares of Smith & Wesson.
“In order to actually make this shareholder activism work, this nun group needs to get support from other investment groups,” Professor Wu said.
In the lawsuit, the nuns asked Smith & Wesson to change its marketing to limit the appeal of guns to young men and people who would be inspired by militaristic imagery in the company’s advertising to use guns “against their perceived enemies.”
“We call on Smith & Wesson to return to the practices of its first 153 years of existence when it held itself as a successful beacon of responsible gun ownership and did not manufacture, market or sell military-grade, mass-killing assault weapons,” the nuns said in a statement.
In recent years, groups seeking to combat gun violence in the United States have turned to novel legal tactics to get around the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a federal law protecting gun companies from litigation that Congress enacted in 2005.

Survivors and families of victims of a Fourth of July shooting last year in Highland Park, Ill., sued Smith & Wesson over its marketing. Seven people were killed and more than 30 people were injured, ranging from children to older adults, in the shooting.
Smith & Wesson began making AR-15-style rifles in January 2006, two years after a federal assault weapons ban expired, the nuns’ lawsuit said. The ban had outlawed specific military-style semiautomatic weapons and magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifles were used in several recent mass shootings, including by the gunman who killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, in October. After a two-day manhunt, the gunman was found dead with a Smith & Wesson handgun and an AR-15-style rifle, officials said.

New Jersey is investigating Smith & Wesson’s advertising practices.

Tim Gruber for The New York Times
A new front in the gun control fight
Federal laws have protected gun makers from liability from gun crimes and deaths. But officials in New Jersey are taking a novel approach to investigating the industry that hasn’t drawn much attention, Andrew writes in his latest column: They’re going after Smith & Wesson, one of the biggest manufacturers, over its advertising practices.
New Jersey has taken aim at Smith & Wesson’s marketing, in what it describes as a “garden-variety” investigation by the state’s consumer affairs division. At issue are ads like a TV commercial that shows a woman carrying a pistol in a handbag everywhere she goes, from the office to the gym. But nearly everything in that ad is illegal in most states if she didn’t have a concealed carry permit. New Jersey said it’s investigating potential advertising fraud.
The real aim is to unearth internal documents from Smith & Wesson, with the goal of exposing the industry’s workings. Gun manufacturers have been able to resist previous legal fights for such material, including by filing for bankruptcy.
Smith & Wesson’s response: The investigation “seeks to suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda that the attorney general publicly committed to pursue,” the company argued in a lawsuit to prevent New Jersey from enforcing its subpoena for documents. The company adds that its advertising is protected by the Second Amendment and a federal law meant to shield the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits.
But there’s an exception: The law excludes “an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.” In other words, investigating advertising is fair game.

The big takeaway, according to Andrew: This might be the case that finally produces the sort of exposures that helped turn the tide against tobacco companies in the 1990s. “When the industry in question has long felt protected by special laws,” he writes, “it’s possible that the material could be particularly revealing.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Exxon Mobil adds the activist investor Jeff Ubben to its board. The oil giant appointed Mr. Ubben and Michael Angelakis, a former C.F.O. of Comcast, amid pressure from hedge funds to boost its stock price and shift from fossil fuels. Separately, a top oil industry trade group plans to endorse putting a price on carbon emissions.
The pandemic didn’t hit state finances as badly as once feared. New figures show that many states averted disaster, thanks largely to $600-a-week federal payouts that let the unemployed keep spending — and generating sales tax. The data stoked debate about the additional funding for states included in the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.
Is it finally time for infrastructure week? President Biden is focused on passing his stimulus proposal, but is expected to call soon after for billions in spending on highways, bridges and more. It won’t be easy: He’ll need either complete unity from Senate Democrats or some support from Senate Republicans.
Private equity C.E.O.s record nine-figure paydays despite the pandemic. Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone received at least $615 million last year, while Leon Black of Apollo collected at least $225 million. Much of that came from dividends paid by their firms.

President Biden expresses solidarity toward Amazon workers seeking to unionize. In a video posted to Twitter, Mr. Biden avoided a direct endorsement of efforts to form a union at an Alabama warehouse. But he warned that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”
Image
Grilling Gary Gensler
Gary Gensler, President Biden’s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, fields questions regularly as a professor at M.I.T. But today, his audience consists of senators on the banking committee, who will vet his nomination by asking him about some of the same topics as his students — like cryptocurrency and financial market plumbing — in a more pointed fashion.
Republicans’ focus, a person familiar with the committee minority’s thinking told DealBook, will be on Mr. Gensler’s record as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama. They believe he revealed a tendency to “aggressively” advocate for regulation and stretch regulatory power to its limits. Their fear is that he will write rules to advance liberal policy priorities, citing climate change specifically.
Corporate climate disclosures will be a hot topic. The S.E.C. last week said it would look more closely at corporate climate statements, and Mr. Gensler’s opening statement calls for “strengthening transparency and accountability in our markets” in general. Democrats say they welcome this.
“I’ll be carefully watching Gary Gensler’s answers on issues like climate risk disclosure, corporate diversity, and investor protection,” said Tina Smith of Minnesota.
Bob Menendez of New Jersey intends to ask about increased disclosure of corporate political spending, a spokesperson said. He wants companies to reveal more about their donations and seek shareholder approval for spending.
Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is curious about the rules and limits on the timing and disclosure of insider stock trades.
And then there is GameStop. The committee chairman, Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, railed against Wall Street during the meme-stock frenzy, and that episode is sure to come up today. A spokesperson for Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that he intends to probe Mr. Gensler about payment for order flow.

The Bitcoin senator meets the blockchain professor. Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, is the first senator to hold Bitcoin; she will focus on the nominee’s commitment to “financial regulations that foster innovation,” according to a spokesperson. Mr. Gensler, who teaches cryptocurrency courses at M.I.T. and is also a former Goldman banker, should be game. Alluding to his job at the intersection of finance and technology, the banker-turned-regulator-turned-academic cautiously acknowledged the promise of fintech in his statement and said rules must evolve with new tools.
“We all want to go back to the office, right? We are stuck in our home for such a long time, so painful.”

Can private equity craft a deal for Michaels?
Private equity firms are circling the craft supply retailer Michaels, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch reported yesterday. Though like many brick-and-mortar chains it had struggled to compete with e-commerce, it saw its shares soar during the pandemic as people turned to hobbies under stay-at-home orders and it upgraded its online capabilities.
Companies are looking to capitalize on pandemic business bumps. Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts, which was recently on credit ratings watchlists, has filed for an I.P.O. The high-end grill maker Traeger and the golf equipment brand TaylorMade are both considering multibillion-dollar deals.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s not clear whether Michaels will agree to a deal, but its biggest shareholder, Bain Capital, may see a good opportunity to cash out 14 years after it acquired the retailer, with Blackstone, for $6 billion. Private equity firms were buying a lot of retailers back then, only to be caught out by the rise of Amazon and prowess of big box retailers like Walmart. Bain took Michaels public in 2014 in a deal that valued it at about $3.5 billion. Its current market cap is around $2.5 billion.
Private equity has money to spend. Buyout groups have about $1 trillion in so-called dry powder. But the competition for targets is fierce, given the billions that SPACs have raised and the lofty valuations they’ll offer any company with growth potential. In retail, there is a stark divide between pandemic-era winners and losers.
A crucial question: What pandemic trends will stick? Michaels has invested in e-commerce, winning accolades from analysts. It’s also started a bulk-buy program catering to entrepreneurs and small businesses. Whether that’s enough to bolster it against a potential downturn in crafting, as people spend less time at home, is a needle a new owner may have to thread.
Democracy for the economy
Today, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a voting rights case that has elicited a friend-of-the-court brief from over 70 companies, and more than 200 academics and business leaders. At stake is what The Times’s Adam Liptak calls the court’s “most important election case in almost a decade.”
ADVERTISEMENT

The case involves efforts by Arizona to restrict voting rights. The Democratic National Committee, which brought the suit against Arizona’s Republican attorney general, argues that two of the state’s voting restrictions disproportionately affect minority voters. Arizona argues its restrictions are common-sense protections against voter fraud.
“Business leaders have a strong interest in this case,” the signatories wrote in their brief, which calls for the Supreme Court to side with the Democratic challengers. They argued that “the strength of America’s economy and markets rest on one of the founding principles of our democracy: the right to vote,” and added, “This is not a partisan issue.”
Their brief points to data showing the economic benefits of diversity in employment, and argues that a “diverse and inclusive voting population is “vital to creating an environment that fosters economic growth.”
Signatories include AIG, Booz Allen Hamilton, Etsy, Levi Strauss, PayPal and SurveyMonkey, as well as executives from Bridgewater Associates, Facebook and WeWork.

U.S. Judge Blocks Rule Extending Reach of Labor Law to Franchisers

March 11, 2024
A federal judge, siding with business lobbying groups, has blocked a rule that would broaden the reach of federal labor law to make big franchisers like McDonald’s responsible for the conditions of workers they have not directly hired.
The judge, J. Campbell Barker of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, on Friday vacated a rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board determining when a company is a joint employer, making it liable under labor law for the working conditions of those hired by a franchisee or provided by a staffing agency. He said the rule, which was to go into effect Monday, was too broad.
The decision by Judge Barker, a nominee of former President Donald J. Trump, keeps in place a more business-friendly standard for assigning legal liability.
Unions and employees support the rule because it makes it easier to bargain for better conditions, while franchisers say it would disrupt their business model.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which led a group of business groups challenging the rule, applauded the ruling. “It will prevent businesses from facing new liabilities related to workplaces they don’t control, and workers they don’t actually employ,” Suzanne P. Clark, chief executive of the chamber, said in a statement.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Port Workers: A contract covering longshore workers on the East and Gulf Coasts will expire at the end of September, but talks have been stalled over the use of automation, raising the likelihood of a strike.
Hotel Workers: About 10,000 hotel workers across the United States walked off the job on Labor Day weekend in an attempt to disrupt holiday travel after failing to come to an agreement in contract negotiations.
Wonderful Nurseries: The company — part of the Wonderful Company, the conglomerate behind Fiji Water — has sued California to overturn a labor organizing law championed by the United Farm Workers.
The labor board’s chair, Lauren McFerran, who was named by President Biden, said in a statement that the ruling was “a disappointing setback,” but “not the last word” on the joint-employer standard. If the board appeals the ruling, the case would move to the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The labor agency pushed for the case to be moved to Washington, but Judge Barker denied that request.
The rule in dispute, issued in October by the labor board’s Democratic majority, would classify a parent company as a joint employer if it has control — direct or indirect — over even one condition of employment. The current standard, adopted in 2020 when the board was led by Republicans, classifies a company as a joint employer only if it exerts direct control over workers.
Nurses hired by a staffing agency, for example, may work at a hospital that determines their schedules but does not directly establish their pay. If those nurses seek to unionize, they may argue that the hospital indirectly determines their pay based on how much it pays to contract their work. Under the rule issued in October, the hospital would probably be considered a joint employer, but under the current standard, it would have an easier time arguing that the onus falls only on the staffing agency that signs the nurses’ paychecks.
The new rule “would treat virtually every entity that contracts for labor as a joint employer because virtually every contract for third-party labor has terms that impact, at least indirectly, at least one of the specified ‘essential terms and conditions of employment,’” Judge Barker wrote in his decision.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The issue has big implications for companies like McDonald’s, which relies heavily on the franchise model in which most restaurants under its brand are operated by independent owners. Unions and businesses have for years disagreed on whether those chains should be required to come to the bargaining table and be held responsible for labor law violations.
The rule in dispute would expose virtually all franchisers because they are required to maintain certain standards over the operations handled by franchisees, said Jim Paretti, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson. His firm represented Associated Builders and Contractors and the International Franchise Association, two of the trade groups challenging the rule.
“That’s why they see it as an existential threat to the business model,” Mr. Paretti said.

Victims of Highland Park Shooting Sue Gun Maker and Retailers
Lawsuits filed Tuesday in Lake County, Ill., argue that Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Fourth of July attack, “deceptively and unfairly” marketed its weapons.

Sept. 29, 2022
Survivors and families of victims of the Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Ill., have filed lawsuits against Smith & Wesson, citing its marketing of the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack. The plaintiffs also sued two gun stores, the accused gunman and his father.
As mass shootings have become a painfully common occurrence and most federal gun control efforts have failed, suing gun manufacturers over their marketing is a novel legal tactic that plaintiffs have begun using as a way around a federal law protecting gun companies from litigation.
Seven people were killed and more than 30 people were injured, ranging in age from 8 to 85, in the Highland Park shooting, which took place during a parade in the city, about 25 miles north of downtown Chicago.
Robert E. Crimo III, who was 21 at the time, was indicted in July on 21 counts of first-degree murder, or three counts for each fatality, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, according to the Lake County State’s Attorney’s Office.

The lawsuits were announced on Wednesday by representatives of three of the people who were killed, as well as several others who were wounded or traumatized. The suits also name Bud’s Gun Shop, Red Dot Arms, Mr. Crimo and his father, Robert Crimo Jr., as defendants.
The suits were filed Tuesday in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit in Lake County, and are seeking a jury trial.
Gunmakers are protected from being held liable for mass shootings by a federal shield law, the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. But families of those killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting argued that marketing of the weapon by Remington, the gunmaker, violated a state consumer protection law. In February, Remington agreed to pay $73 million to families of nine Sandy Hook shooting victims over the AR-15-style rifle used in the 2012 massacre, believed to be the largest such settlement by a gun manufacturer.
The Highland Park lawsuits are employing a similar tactic to those used in the Remington case. The filings allege that Mr. Crimo, using a Smith & Wesson, “was able to act out his violent fantasy — like so many disturbed and hate-filled young men before him.” They argue that the shooting played out in an entirely foreseeable way, “with extreme and limitless power,” just as the gun manufacturer had advertised.
Smith & Wesson’s marketing of the semiautomatic rifle, they add, misleadingly implied a link between its military and police line of rifles and the U.S. military, especially to appeal to individuals like Mr. Crimo.

The suits also argue that two gun stores — Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms — negligently and illegally sold the murder weapon to Mr. Crimo in violation of an assault weapons ban in Highwood and Highland Park, Ill.
According to the complaints, Mr. Crimo’s father also acted negligently by sponsoring his son’s firearm application when he was just 19, and shortly after he had attempted suicide and had threatened to kill everyone in his house.
Suing the parent of an alleged gunman is another rare legal tactic that the Highland Park plaintiffs are using. In a criminal case, an Oakland County, Mich., prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges in December against the parents of the suspect in last year’s shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Detroit.
“The July 4th mass shooting in Highland Park wasn’t just an act of one troubled young man,” Alla Lefkowitz, the senior director of affirmative litigation at Everytown Law, one of the firms representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement released Wednesday.
She added, “He used a gun that was deceptively and unfairly marketed to him by Smith & Wesson, illegally sold to him by Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms, and negligently put in his hands by his father.”

Smith & Wesson and Bud’s Gun Shop did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. A representative from Red Dot Arms, reached by phone Thursday, said the company had no comment on the suits.
Lorena Rebollar Sedano, who was shot in the attack, said in a statement that her life was irrevocably changed by the Fourth of July attack.
“Because of the marketing and advertising of these kinds of weapons, our lives will not be the same,” Ms. Sedano added. “That is why we demand justice so that this person pays and all those responsible pay for what they did.”

After taking bullets, Smith & Wesson lives
Share full article
By Leslie Wayne
April 6, 2006
SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts:It is hard to imagine a company sinking as low as Smith & Wesson, the legendary arms maker that equipped soldiers from the Civil War to Vietnam and, at one time, 98 percent of America's police forces.
Just two years ago, the company's chairman was found to be a convicted felon: He failed to disclose having spent15 years in jail for armed robbery. U.S. investigators were looking into accounting irregularities, and the company's stock was stuck at $1.50 a share.
Adding to the company's troubles, for nearly a decade all American soldiers have carried Italian-made Berettas, while most police forces long ago switched to handguns from Glock, an Austrian company.
But now, with new owners and a new chief executive, Michael Golden, who once sold power tools for Black & Decker and toilets for Kohler, Smith & Wesson is coming back to life - thanks to an expanding Pentagon budget and growing spending from the Homeland Security Department.

With consumer sales of rifles, shotguns and handguns flat for the past decade, Smith & Wesson is casting its lot with Washington, where it is making headway with a new "Buy America" pitch in Congress and at the Pentagon.
The company recently won contracts to supply pistols to the fledging Afghan security forces, its first Pentagon award in 15 years. Next, it wants to put Smith & Wesson back into the hands of every American soldier - a major contract worth as much as $600 million.
Smith & Wesson was not the only American gun maker whose fortunes had fallen in recent years. Just last month, in nearby New Haven, Connecticut, the Winchester firearms factory, where the "Gun That Won The West" was made for 150 years, closed its doors. Another neighbor, Colt's Manufacturing, is a shadow of its former self and is now known mainly for a single product, the M-16, which it sells to the Pentagon.
But Smith & Wesson fell more dramatically than the others, mainly because of its agreement in 2000 to adopt gun safety measures to settle lawsuits brought by state and federal agencies in the United States. That Clinton-era accord resulted in a boycott by the National Rifle Association and made Smith & Wesson an industry outcast.
The mood in Washington has changed since then, and to the company's advantage. A gun-friendly administration and a new law signed last autumn by President George W. Bush - the "Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms" act, which shields gun makers from lawsuits - have undercut the anti- gun movement.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Lawsuits against gun makers have largely been tossed out of court, and the end of a 10-year ban on assault weapons is encouraging the gun industry to make new, more powerful weapons, with higher price tags.
"This is a 154-year old legacy brand that everyone knows and likes," said Golden in an interview in his officedecorated with memorabilia of sharpshooters and historic firearms. "But we had no sales to the federal government. Zero. None. We had no representatives in Washington. No lobbying firms."
For help in Washington, the company hired the lobbying firm of Greenberg Traurig, where the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff once worked, and paid it $120,000 in the second half of 2005 alone, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, an independent campaign finance Web site. And Golden and Smith & Wesson executives began calling on lawmakers themselves.
"I'm amazed how easy it is to get audiences with key members of the House and Senate and the agencies,"Golden said. "They always say, 'Where have you guys been; we haven't seen you in years.'"
For the past decade, a steady 3 million to 3.3 million guns - rifles, shotguns and handguns - have been sold annually in the United States, with

sales estimated at about $1.4 billion a year.
In the meantime, the federal budget for small arms has continued to grow, not only for American soldiers and other government agents, but also for Iraqi and Afghan government forces.
"The government is the only business that is expanding," said Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, based in Washington. "The civilian market is not, while the government is putting tens of billions of dollars into homeland security."
It remains to be seen whether Smith & Wesson's improving fortunes are a one- time blip or the beginning of a trend.

In New Tack in Gun Debate, a Call to Investigate Smith & Wesson’s Disclosures

The New York City public advocate on Monday asked federal regulators to investigate whether the gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson had made adequate disclosures in its financial statements.
In an eight-page letter, the public advocate, Letitia James, said the Securities and Exchange Commission should examine whether Smith & Wesson misrepresented or omitted information about how often its products are involved in crimes and what it has done to keep its guns out of the hands of criminals.
Shareholders would want to know whether Smith & Wesson faced heightened regulatory scrutiny or significant litigation risk, Ms. James said in the letter.
Nearly two weeks ago, a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., left 14 people dead and provoked a fresh outcry about gun violence in America. It also is the third anniversary of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults.

“With the increase in mass shootings, public concern about the proliferation of firearms has animated a national dialogue about gun control measures, interstate gun trafficking, and whether gun manufacturers should take additional steps to ensure that their products do not end up in the hands of criminals,” the letter says. “Smith & Wesson knows that it is at risk of grave reputational harm.”
Ms. James is opening a new avenue in her fight against gun sellers and makers. Earlier this month, she called on TD Bank, a big lender, to stop financing Smith & Wesson. This summer, she convinced the New York City Employee Retirement System, the city’s largest pension fund, to explore divesting itself of its holdings of gun retailers like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
Smith & Wesson, based in Springfield, Mass., is one of the country’s largest gun makers, and in a securities filing says it makes 50 percent of all the revolvers owned in the United States. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Large United States pension funds have used similar tactics to push big energy companies to disclose more about their climate change-related risks, including spending on Arctic drilling and Canadian oil sands projects. Exxon Mobil is facing new legal challenges by those who argue it should have acted earlier to address the risks of climate change.
Guns could be the next focus of such shareholder efforts, though there were no new gun-related proposals submitted for the 2015 annual shareholder proxies last spring, nor any yet for 2016, according to Institutional Shareholder Services.

A 2014 proposal for the Walmart annual proxy submitted by Trinity Church of New York focused on the retailer’s sale of semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. The S.E.C. allowed Walmart to keep it off its proxy that year. The church sued to keep it in, but lost on appeal and recently withdrew a request to the United States Supreme Court to hear the matter.

The Most Important Gun Lawsuit You’ve Never Heard Of
A case in New Jersey about Smith & Wesson’s advertising could expose secrets that the industry would prefer to keep hidden.

She places her gun in a red leather handbag and gets into her car. The gun, in her bag, sits in the front seat of the vehicle as she drives to work. She then brings the gun, still in the bag, to a meeting with colleagues at the office. She then takes the gun, in her bag, to lunch, where she sits at an outdoor cafe. After that, she goes to the gym — and the gun comes with her. Finally, she goes to a shooting range, where she takes the gun out and fires it at a target. “Nice pistol,” says the man next to her.
That’s the plot of a television commercial for Smith & Wesson.
However, almost everything in the ad would be illegal in at least 35 states if the woman did not have a concealed carry permit, which the ad ignores.
A largely overlooked lawsuit is playing out in New Jersey about the way Smith & Wesson advertises its wares, but the truth is the case is about much more than advertising. The outcome could have profound implications for the gun industry.
In business and policy circles, and within the gun industry itself, the case is seen as the country’s most consequential legal battle over the future of gun control.

At a time when big companies have taken a stand against gun violence — the influential Business Roundtable lobby group has called on Congress to enact stricter laws — corporate America is watching closely.
Gun manufacturers have long been immune from liability for gun crimes and deaths because of federal laws that protect them. As a result, virtually no one has been able to mount a legal case that would allow for access to records from inside a gun manufacturer, be it internal emails, memos, notes or other material showing what gun industry executives say behind closed doors about the products they make.
But Phil Murphy, the Democratic governor of New Jersey — a longtime gun control advocate — decided to do something novel: In October, his attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, sent a subpoena to Smith & Wesson from the state’s division of consumer affairs as part of an investigation into advertising fraud, seeking a trove of internal documents. No industry has any particular immunity from cases about the claims it makes in advertising.

In truth, the subpoena is a Trojan horse to expose publicly, for the first time, the inner workings of the gun industry.

“The gun industry is afraid of nothing more than the ability of the public to see behind the scenes and to see their internal documents and to have their executives sit down and face the music,” said J. Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The case has the potential to put a spotlight on the inner workings of gun manufacturers similar to the tobacco industry in the 1990s.
“Public opinion turned so dramatically against the tobacco companies when it became clear that executives knew the truth about their products and were lying to the public,” Mr. Skaggs said. “The gun industry fears the same thing.”
The industry has been trying to avoid a moment like this for years. Just as a court was about to rule in a lawsuit against Remington brought by the families of children killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, the company filed for bankruptcy, delaying the case. The National Rifle Association declared bankruptcy this year in an effort to end an investigation by the New York attorney general.

In December, Smith & Wesson sued the State of New Jersey in federal court seeking to enjoin the state court from enforcing the subpoena.
The company argued that the case wasn’t about advertising. “In reality, it seeks to suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda that the attorney general publicly committed to pursue,” Smith & Wesson said in its filing.
It suggested that officials in New Jersey sought “to bypass the legislative ‘process’ and engage in abusive litigation, along with investigatory and other tactics, to create sufficient ‘pressure’ to compel Smith & Wesson to ‘voluntarily’ adopt ‘reforms’ consistent with the activists’ gun control agenda.”
In a motion to dismiss the suit last month, Mr. Grewal argued that Smith & Wesson “attempts to turn a garden-variety state consumer-fraud investigation into a federal constitutional case.” The state’s consumer affairs division, “like similar state consumer agencies all across the country,” the filing noted, “regularly initiates investigations and enforcement actions to protect consumers from unlawful business practices involving a range of goods and services.”
Let’s call New Jersey’s reply what it is: disingenuous. The court knows — and clearly Smith & Wesson knows — that the advertising fraud investigation is not “garden-variety” anything.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the motive of the investigation, for the purposes of the law, is beside the point. The case will rest on whether Smith & Wesson breached state laws that prevent companies from misleading customers.
And that’s where New Jersey’s case is particularly clever.
Specifically, Smith & Wesson claims that its advertising is protected by the Second Amendment and the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was enacted in 2005 to prevent frivolous suits against the gun industry.
But as New Jersey argued, the law excludes “an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.” In other words, an investigation into gun advertising is fair game.
Whether a subpoena will ultimately turn up emails and notes from gun executives discussing their role in the gun violence that has engulfed the country is anyone’s guess. But if history is a guide, when thousands of internal documents are exposed there is often unflattering material. And when the industry in question has long felt protected by special laws, it’s possible that the material could be particularly revealing.
Whatever the case, we may finally be able to see it.

Smith & Wesson’s Owner to Break Away From Gun Business
The move separates the broader company from the challenges the gun industry faces. It was announced shortly before another mass shooting.

The gun-maker Smith & Wesson was once an iconic national brand, a symbol of Americana and rugged individualism dating back to the battlefields of the Civil War.
But over the last two years, Smith & Wesson’s parent company, American Outdoor Brands, has seen its stock price plunge as public and investor pressure to curb gun violence has grown.
Late Wednesday, the company said it was spinning off its firearms unit, insulating the broader business from the challenges facing the gun industry.
The decision was motivated by “significant changes in the political climate as well as the economic, investing and insurance markets,” Barry M. Monheit, chairman of American Outdoor Brands, said in a statement.

Less than a day after the announcement, a shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita, Calif., left two students dead and three wounded.
Timothy D. Lytton, an expert on the firearm industry at Georgia State University, said the violence of the last few years had drawn “a lot of unwanted attention” to Smith & Wesson, whose firearms have been used in several mass shootings.
“A national brand that is involved in a lot of different sectors wants to provide some measure of distance between itself and a company that has been repeatedly associated with high-profile shootings,” Mr. Lytton said.
A shift in public opinion polls in favor of more gun control has influenced retailers across the United States, especially after back-to-back shootings this summer in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.
In September, Walmart said it would stop selling ammunition that could be used in military-style assault rifles like the one fired by a gunman in one of its stores in El Paso.

The next month, Dick’s Sporting Goods, which has grappled publicly with its ties to the gun industry, said it had destroyed more than $5 million worth of military-style, semiautomatic rifles. Its chief executive, Ed Stack, has said the company is considering whether it will continue to sell guns.
Rising consumer outrage is not the only issue facing companies like American Outdoor Brands. Some families of mass shooting victims have sued retailers and gunmakers in an attempt to make them accountable. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court allowed relatives of shooting victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., to move forward with a lawsuit against Remington Arms, the maker of the rifle used in the 2012 massacre.
A drawn-out legal fight and the headlines that would come with it are “something the parent company probably wants to avoid,” said Mr. Lytton, the gun expert at Georgia State. “By splitting Smith & Wesson off, they’re more likely to insulate themselves from that litigation and reputational damage.”
Separating from Smith & Wesson may also simply be a smart business decision for American Outdoor Brands: Sales from its firearms segment have fallen 38 percent since 2017.
That drop has come during a broader downswing for the industry since the 2016 presidential election, as gun owners have become less worried about the prospect that the government might seize their weapons.

Gun-makers tend to enjoy their greatest success when political forces seem to be arrayed against the industry, said Allen Rostron, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.
“People being upset about gun violence isn’t going to put a gun company out of business,” Mr. Rostron said. “The people who are going to protest and boycott — they’re not buying guns.”
Under the restructuring, which will go into effect next year, American Outdoor Brands will focus on its outdoor equipment business, like Hooyman tree saws and Bubba fishing gear, the company said. Smith & Wesson Brands will become a separate, publicly traded company.
In recent years, other gunmakers have also responded to the changing economic climate. Remington sought bankruptcy protection in March 2018 after sales fell and its debt piled up. In September, Colt said it would suspend production of sporting rifles, including its signature AR-15, for the civilian market, citing market conditions.
Wall Street has also started to rethink its close ties with gun-makers.
Last year, Citigroup said it would require business customers to restrict certain firearms sales, while Bank of America said it would stop lending to manufacturers of military-inspired firearms for civilian use. Other companies, like the investment management firm BlackRock, have asked firearms companies for details about their business practices.

American Outdoor Brands is not the first major outdoors company to spin off its firearms business. After the fatal 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., which involved an AR-15 rifle, REI suspended orders of bike helmets and water bottles made by Vista Outdoor, protesting the company’s production of assault-style firearms.
Two months later, Vista Outdoor announced that it would sell its gun-making business.
The AR-15 used in Parkland, however, was made by Smith & Wesson, whose products have been implicated in several other high-profile shootings. A 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun was used in the attack on YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., in 2018. One of the firearms owned by the gunman who attacked a Colorado movie theater in 2012 was made by Smith & Wesson.
And in February, a fired employee returned to a suburban Chicago factory with a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun with a laser sight, which the authorities said he used to kill five of his former co-workers.
Since its founding in the 1850s, Smith & Wesson has long occupied a singular place in the public imagination, associated with the Civil War and the exploration of the American West. But it has also faced decades of backlash from gun-control advocates. In 2000, Smith & Wesson was nearly put out of business when gun owners boycotted it after it agreed to marketing and design regulations proposed by the Clinton administration.

After the restructuring, Mark Smith, the president of the manufacturing services division at American Outdoor Brands, will take up the role of chief executive at Smith & Wesson Brands.

Dec. 7, 2023
A coalition of four Catholic nun congregations said in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday that the gun maker Smith & Wesson has put shareholders at risk in the way it makes, markets and sells its AR-15-style rifle.
The nuns, who are Smith & Wesson shareholders, argue that the gun maker is exposing itself to liability by intentionally violating laws in its production and sale of the rifles, which have been used in several high-profile mass shootings.
The lawsuit, filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nev., states that Smith & Wesson “has enjoyed with abandon the record-breaking profits from its sale of AR-15 rifles, seemingly unfazed by the exponential rise in gun deaths and mass shootings carried out with its product in the United States.”
The nuns are from Adrian Dominican Sisters in Adrian, Mich.; the Sisters of Bon Secours USA in Marriottsville, Md.; the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia in Aston, Pa.; and the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, U.S.-Ontario Province in Marylhurst, Ore.

Mark Smith, the chief executive and president of Smith & Wesson, said in a statement that the nuns were “not interested in the best interests of the company or its stockholders.”
He added, “This frivolous lawsuit is simply another instance in their long history of attempting to hijack and abuse the shareholder advocacy process to harm our reputation and company.”
Earlier this year, the nuns sponsored a resolution to have Smith & Wesson conduct an assessment of the human rights impact of its business practices, but a majority of shareholders voted against it in September.
The nuns’ action this week is a derivative lawsuit, a legal mechanism that allows shareholders to sue the leaders of a company for breaching their duties.
Jeffrey Norton, the lead lawyer for the nuns’ coalition, said on Thursday that his clients collectively owned more than 1,000 shares of Smith & Wesson.

Jennifer Wu, a clinical assistant professor of finance at the University at Buffalo School of Management, said that 1,000 shares was a “very, very small” amount of the 46 million outstanding shares of Smith & Wesson.
“In order to actually make this shareholder activism work, this nun group needs to get support from other investment groups,” Professor Wu said.
In the lawsuit, the nuns asked Smith & Wesson to change its marketing to limit the appeal of guns to young men and people who would be inspired by militaristic imagery in the company’s advertising to use guns “against their perceived enemies.”
“We call on Smith & Wesson to return to the practices of its first 153 years of existence when it held itself as a successful beacon of responsible gun ownership and did not manufacture, market or sell military-grade, mass-killing assault weapons,” the nuns said in a statement.
In recent years, groups seeking to combat gun violence in the United States have turned to novel legal tactics to get around the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a federal law protecting gun companies from litigation that Congress enacted in 2005.

Survivors and families of victims of a Fourth of July shooting last year in Highland Park, Ill., sued Smith & Wesson over its marketing. Seven people were killed and more than 30 people were injured, ranging from children to older adults, in the shooting.
Smith & Wesson began making AR-15-style rifles in January 2006, two years after a federal assault weapons ban expired, the nuns’ lawsuit said. The ban had outlawed specific military-style semiautomatic weapons and magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifles were used in several recent mass shootings, including by the gunman who killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, in October. After a two-day manhunt, the gunman was found dead with a Smith & Wesson handgun and an AR-15-style rifle, officials said.

New Jersey is investigating Smith & Wesson’s advertising practices.

A new front in the gun control fight
Federal laws have protected gun makers from liability from gun crimes and deaths. But officials in New Jersey are taking a novel approach to investigating the industry that hasn’t drawn much attention, Andrew writes in his latest column: They’re going after Smith & Wesson, one of the biggest manufacturers, over its advertising practices.
New Jersey has taken aim at Smith & Wesson’s marketing, in what it describes as a “garden-variety” investigation by the state’s consumer affairs division. At issue are ads like a TV commercial that shows a woman carrying a pistol in a handbag everywhere she goes, from the office to the gym. But nearly everything in that ad is illegal in most states if she didn’t have a concealed carry permit. New Jersey said it’s investigating potential advertising fraud.
The real aim is to unearth internal documents from Smith & Wesson, with the goal of exposing the industry’s workings. Gun manufacturers have been able to resist previous legal fights for such material, including by filing for bankruptcy.
Smith & Wesson’s response: The investigation “seeks to suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda that the attorney general publicly committed to pursue,” the company argued in a lawsuit to prevent New Jersey from enforcing its subpoena for documents. The company adds that its advertising is protected by the Second Amendment and a federal law meant to shield the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits.
But there’s an exception: The law excludes “an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.” In other words, investigating advertising is fair game.

The big takeaway, according to Andrew: This might be the case that finally produces the sort of exposures that helped turn the tide against tobacco companies in the 1990s. “When the industry in question has long felt protected by special laws,” he writes, “it’s possible that the material could be particularly revealing.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Exxon Mobil adds the activist investor Jeff Ubben to its board. The oil giant appointed Mr. Ubben and Michael Angelakis, a former C.F.O. of Comcast, amid pressure from hedge funds to boost its stock price and shift from fossil fuels. Separately, a top oil industry trade group plans to endorse putting a price on carbon emissions.
The pandemic didn’t hit state finances as badly as once feared. New figures show that many states averted disaster, thanks largely to $600-a-week federal payouts that let the unemployed keep spending — and generating sales tax. The data stoked debate about the additional funding for states included in the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.
Is it finally time for infrastructure week? President Biden is focused on passing his stimulus proposal, but is expected to call soon after for billions in spending on highways, bridges and more. It won’t be easy: He’ll need either complete unity from Senate Democrats or some support from Senate Republicans.
Private equity C.E.O.s record nine-figure paydays despite the pandemic. Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone received at least $615 million last year, while Leon Black of Apollo collected at least $225 million. Much of that came from dividends paid by their firms.

President Biden expresses solidarity toward Amazon workers seeking to unionize. In a video posted to Twitter, Mr. Biden avoided a direct endorsement of efforts to form a union at an Alabama warehouse. But he warned that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”

Grilling Gary Gensler
Gary Gensler, President Biden’s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, fields questions regularly as a professor at M.I.T. But today, his audience consists of senators on the banking committee, who will vet his nomination by asking him about some of the same topics as his students — like cryptocurrency and financial market plumbing — in a more pointed fashion.
Republicans’ focus, a person familiar with the committee minority’s thinking told DealBook, will be on Mr. Gensler’s record as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama. They believe he revealed a tendency to “aggressively” advocate for regulation and stretch regulatory power to its limits. Their fear is that he will write rules to advance liberal policy priorities, citing climate change specifically.
Corporate climate disclosures will be a hot topic. The S.E.C. last week said it would look more closely at corporate climate statements, and Mr. Gensler’s opening statement calls for “strengthening transparency and accountability in our markets” in general. Democrats say they welcome this.
“I’ll be carefully watching Gary Gensler’s answers on issues like climate risk disclosure, corporate diversity, and investor protection,” said Tina Smith of Minnesota.
Bob Menendez of New Jersey intends to ask about increased disclosure of corporate political spending, a spokesperson said. He wants companies to reveal more about their donations and seek shareholder approval for spending.
Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is curious about the rules and limits on the timing and disclosure of insider stock trades.
And then there is GameStop. The committee chairman, Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, railed against Wall Street during the meme-stock frenzy, and that episode is sure to come up today. A spokesperson for Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that he intends to probe Mr. Gensler about payment for order flow.

The Bitcoin senator meets the blockchain professor. Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, is the first senator to hold Bitcoin; she will focus on the nominee’s commitment to “financial regulations that foster innovation,” according to a spokesperson. Mr. Gensler, who teaches cryptocurrency courses at M.I.T. and is also a former Goldman banker, should be game. Alluding to his job at the intersection of finance and technology, the banker-turned-regulator-turned-academic cautiously acknowledged the promise of fintech in his statement and said rules must evolve with new tools.
“We all want to go back to the office, right? We are stuck in our home for such a long time, so painful.”

Can private equity craft a deal for Michaels?
Private equity firms are circling the craft supply retailer Michaels, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch reported yesterday. Though like many brick-and-mortar chains it had struggled to compete with e-commerce, it saw its shares soar during the pandemic as people turned to hobbies under stay-at-home orders and it upgraded its online capabilities.
Companies are looking to capitalize on pandemic business bumps. Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts, which was recently on credit ratings watchlists, has filed for an I.P.O. The high-end grill maker Traeger and the golf equipment brand TaylorMade are both considering multibillion-dollar deals.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s not clear whether Michaels will agree to a deal, but its biggest shareholder, Bain Capital, may see a good opportunity to cash out 14 years after it acquired the retailer, with Blackstone, for $6 billion. Private equity firms were buying a lot of retailers back then, only to be caught out by the rise of Amazon and prowess of big box retailers like Walmart. Bain took Michaels public in 2014 in a deal that valued it at about $3.5 billion. Its current market cap is around $2.5 billion.
Private equity has money to spend. Buyout groups have about $1 trillion in so-called dry powder. But the competition for targets is fierce, given the billions that SPACs have raised and the lofty valuations they’ll offer any company with growth potential. In retail, there is a stark divide between pandemic-era winners and losers.
A crucial question: What pandemic trends will stick? Michaels has invested in e-commerce, winning accolades from analysts. It’s also started a bulk-buy program catering to entrepreneurs and small businesses. Whether that’s enough to bolster it against a potential downturn in crafting, as people spend less time at home, is a needle a new owner may have to thread.
Democracy for the economy
Today, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a voting rights case that has elicited a friend-of-the-court brief from over 70 companies, and more than 200 academics and business leaders. At stake is what The Times’s Adam Liptak calls the court’s “most important election case in almost a decade.”
ADVERTISEMENT

The case involves efforts by Arizona to restrict voting rights. The Democratic National Committee, which brought the suit against Arizona’s Republican attorney general, argues that two of the state’s voting restrictions disproportionately affect minority voters. Arizona argues its restrictions are common-sense protections against voter fraud.
“Business leaders have a strong interest in this case,” the signatories wrote in their brief, which calls for the Supreme Court to side with the Democratic challengers. They argued that “the strength of America’s economy and markets rest on one of the founding principles of our democracy: the right to vote,” and added, “This is not a partisan issue.”
Their brief points to data showing the economic benefits of diversity in employment, and argues that a “diverse and inclusive voting population is “vital to creating an environment that fosters economic growth.”
Signatories include AIG, Booz Allen Hamilton, Etsy, Levi Strauss, PayPal and SurveyMonkey, as well as executives from Bridgewater Associates, Facebook and WeWork.

U.S. Judge Blocks Rule Extending Reach of Labor Law to Franchisers

A federal judge, siding with business lobbying groups, has blocked a rule that would broaden the reach of federal labor law to make big franchisers like McDonald’s responsible for the conditions of workers they have not directly hired.
The judge, J. Campbell Barker of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, on Friday vacated a rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board determining when a company is a joint employer, making it liable under labor law for the working conditions of those hired by a franchisee or provided by a staffing agency. He said the rule, which was to go into effect Monday, was too broad.
The decision by Judge Barker, a nominee of former President Donald J. Trump, keeps in place a more business-friendly standard for assigning legal liability.
Unions and employees support the rule because it makes it easier to bargain for better conditions, while franchisers say it would disrupt their business model.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which led a group of business groups challenging the rule, applauded the ruling. “It will prevent businesses from facing new liabilities related to workplaces they don’t control, and workers they don’t actually employ,” Suzanne P. Clark, chief executive of the chamber, said in a statement.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Port Workers: A contract covering longshore workers on the East and Gulf Coasts will expire at the end of September, but talks have been stalled over the use of automation, raising the likelihood of a strike.
Hotel Workers: About 10,000 hotel workers across the United States walked off the job on Labor Day weekend in an attempt to disrupt holiday travel after failing to come to an agreement in contract negotiations.
Wonderful Nurseries: The company — part of the Wonderful Company, the conglomerate behind Fiji Water — has sued California to overturn a labor organizing law championed by the United Farm Workers.
The labor board’s chair, Lauren McFerran, who was named by President Biden, said in a statement that the ruling was “a disappointing setback,” but “not the last word” on the joint-employer standard. If the board appeals the ruling, the case would move to the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The labor agency pushed for the case to be moved to Washington, but Judge Barker denied that request.
The rule in dispute, issued in October by the labor board’s Democratic majority, would classify a parent company as a joint employer if it has control — direct or indirect — over even one condition of employment. The current standard, adopted in 2020 when the board was led by Republicans, classifies a company as a joint employer only if it exerts direct control over workers.
Nurses hired by a staffing agency, for example, may work at a hospital that determines their schedules but does not directly establish their pay. If those nurses seek to unionize, they may argue that the hospital indirectly determines their pay based on how much it pays to contract their work. Under the rule issued in October, the hospital would probably be considered a joint employer, but under the current standard, it would have an easier time arguing that the onus falls only on the staffing agency that signs the nurses’ paychecks.
The new rule “would treat virtually every entity that contracts for labor as a joint employer because virtually every contract for third-party labor has terms that impact, at least indirectly, at least one of the specified ‘essential terms and conditions of employment,’” Judge Barker wrote in his decision.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The issue has big implications for companies like McDonald’s, which relies heavily on the franchise model in which most restaurants under its brand are operated by independent owners. Unions and businesses have for years disagreed on whether those chains should be required to come to the bargaining table and be held responsible for labor law violations.
The rule in dispute would expose virtually all franchisers because they are required to maintain certain standards over the operations handled by franchisees, said Jim Paretti, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson. His firm represented Associated Builders and Contractors and the International Franchise Association, two of the trade groups challenging the rule.
“That’s why they see it as an existential threat to the business model,” Mr. Paretti said.

Victims of Highland Park Shooting Sue Gun Maker and Retailers
Lawsuits filed Tuesday in Lake County, Ill., argue that Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Fourth of July attack, “deceptively and unfairly” marketed its weapons.

Survivors and families of victims of the Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Ill., have filed lawsuits against Smith & Wesson, citing its marketing of the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack. The plaintiffs also sued two gun stores, the accused gunman and his father.
As mass shootings have become a painfully common occurrence and most federal gun control efforts have failed, suing gun manufacturers over their marketing is a novel legal tactic that plaintiffs have begun using as a way around a federal law protecting gun companies from litigation.
Seven people were killed and more than 30 people were injured, ranging in age from 8 to 85, in the Highland Park shooting, which took place during a parade in the city, about 25 miles north of downtown Chicago.
Robert E. Crimo III, who was 21 at the time, was indicted in July on 21 counts of first-degree murder, or three counts for each fatality, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, according to the Lake County State’s Attorney’s Office.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuits were announced on Wednesday by representatives of three of the people who were killed, as well as several others who were wounded or traumatized. The suits also name Bud’s Gun Shop, Red Dot Arms, Mr. Crimo and his father, Robert Crimo Jr., as defendants.
The suits were filed Tuesday in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit in Lake County, and are seeking a jury trial.
Gunmakers are protected from being held liable for mass shootings by a federal shield law, the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. But families of those killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting argued that marketing of the weapon by Remington, the gunmaker, violated a state consumer protection law. In February, Remington agreed to pay $73 million to families of nine Sandy Hook shooting victims over the AR-15-style rifle used in the 2012 massacre, believed to be the largest such settlement by a gun manufacturer.
The Highland Park lawsuits are employing a similar tactic to those used in the Remington case. The filings allege that Mr. Crimo, using a Smith & Wesson, “was able to act out his violent fantasy — like so many disturbed and hate-filled young men before him.” They argue that the shooting played out in an entirely foreseeable way, “with extreme and limitless power,” just as the gun manufacturer had advertised.
Smith & Wesson’s marketing of the semiautomatic rifle, they add, misleadingly implied a link between its military and police line of rifles and the U.S. military, especially to appeal to individuals like Mr. Crimo.

The suits also argue that two gun stores — Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms — negligently and illegally sold the murder weapon to Mr. Crimo in violation of an assault weapons ban in Highwood and Highland Park, Ill.
According to the complaints, Mr. Crimo’s father also acted negligently by sponsoring his son’s firearm application when he was just 19, and shortly after he had attempted suicide and had threatened to kill everyone in his house.
Suing the parent of an alleged gunman is another rare legal tactic that the Highland Park plaintiffs are using. In a criminal case, an Oakland County, Mich., prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges in December against the parents of the suspect in last year’s shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Detroit.
“The July 4th mass shooting in Highland Park wasn’t just an act of one troubled young man,” Alla Lefkowitz, the senior director of affirmative litigation at Everytown Law, one of the firms representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement released Wednesday.
She added, “He used a gun that was deceptively and unfairly marketed to him by Smith & Wesson, illegally sold to him by Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms, and negligently put in his hands by his father.”

Smith & Wesson and Bud’s Gun Shop did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. A representative from Red Dot Arms, reached by phone Thursday, said the company had no comment on the suits.
Lorena Rebollar Sedano, who was shot in the attack, said in a statement that her life was irrevocably changed by the Fourth of July attack.
“Because of the marketing and advertising of these kinds of weapons, our lives will not be the same,” Ms. Sedano added. “That is why we demand justice so that this person pays and all those responsible pay for what they did.”

After taking bullets, Smith & Wesson lives
Share full article
By Leslie Wayne
April 6, 2006
SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts:It is hard to imagine a company sinking as low as Smith & Wesson, the legendary arms maker that equipped soldiers from the Civil War to Vietnam and, at one time, 98 percent of America's police forces.
Just two years ago, the company's chairman was found to be a convicted felon: He failed to disclose having spent15 years in jail for armed robbery. U.S. investigators were looking into accounting irregularities, and the company's stock was stuck at $1.50 a share.
Adding to the company's troubles, for nearly a decade all American soldiers have carried Italian-made Berettas, while most police forces long ago switched to handguns from Glock, an Austrian company.
But now, with new owners and a new chief executive, Michael Golden, who once sold power tools for Black & Decker and toilets for Kohler, Smith & Wesson is coming back to life - thanks to an expanding Pentagon budget and growing spending from the Homeland Security Department.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
With consumer sales of rifles, shotguns and handguns flat for the past decade, Smith & Wesson is casting its lot with Washington, where it is making headway with a new "Buy America" pitch in Congress and at the Pentagon.
The company recently won contracts to supply pistols to the fledging Afghan security forces, its first Pentagon award in 15 years. Next, it wants to put Smith & Wesson back into the hands of every American soldier - a major contract worth as much as $600 million.
Smith & Wesson was not the only American gun maker whose fortunes had fallen in recent years. Just last month, in nearby New Haven, Connecticut, the Winchester firearms factory, where the "Gun That Won The West" was made for 150 years, closed its doors. Another neighbor, Colt's Manufacturing, is a shadow of its former self and is now known mainly for a single product, the M-16, which it sells to the Pentagon.
But Smith & Wesson fell more dramatically than the others, mainly because of its agreement in 2000 to adopt gun safety measures to settle lawsuits brought by state and federal agencies in the United States. That Clinton-era accord resulted in a boycott by the National Rifle Association and made Smith & Wesson an industry outcast.
The mood in Washington has changed since then, and to the company's advantage. A gun-friendly administration and a new law signed last autumn by President George W. Bush - the "Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms" act, which shields gun makers from lawsuits - have undercut the anti- gun movement.

Lawsuits against gun makers have largely been tossed out of court, and the end of a 10-year ban on assault weapons is encouraging the gun industry to make new, more powerful weapons, with higher price tags.
"This is a 154-year old legacy brand that everyone knows and likes," said Golden in an interview in his officedecorated with memorabilia of sharpshooters and historic firearms. "But we had no sales to the federal government. Zero. None. We had no representatives in Washington. No lobbying firms."
For help in Washington, the company hired the lobbying firm of Greenberg Traurig, where the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff once worked, and paid it $120,000 in the second half of 2005 alone, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, an independent campaign finance Web site. And Golden and Smith & Wesson executives began calling on lawmakers themselves.
"I'm amazed how easy it is to get audiences with key members of the House and Senate and the agencies,"Golden said. "They always say, 'Where have you guys been; we haven't seen you in years.'"
For the past decade, a steady 3 million to 3.3 million guns - rifles, shotguns and handguns - have been sold annually in the United States, with

sales estimated at about $1.4 billion a year.
In the meantime, the federal budget for small arms has continued to grow, not only for American soldiers and other government agents, but also for Iraqi and Afghan government forces.
"The government is the only business that is expanding," said Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, based in Washington. "The civilian market is not, while the government is putting tens of billions of dollars into homeland security."
It remains to be seen whether Smith & Wesson's improving fortunes are a one- time blip or the beginning of a trend.

In New Tack in Gun Debate, a Call to Investigate Smith & Wesson’s Disclosures

The New York City public advocate on Monday asked federal regulators to investigate whether the gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson had made adequate disclosures in its financial statements.
In an eight-page letter, the public advocate, Letitia James, said the Securities and Exchange Commission should examine whether Smith & Wesson misrepresented or omitted information about how often its products are involved in crimes and what it has done to keep its guns out of the hands of criminals.
Shareholders would want to know whether Smith & Wesson faced heightened regulatory scrutiny or significant litigation risk, Ms. James said in the letter.
Nearly two weeks ago, a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., left 14 people dead and provoked a fresh outcry about gun violence in America. It also is the third anniversary of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults.

“With the increase in mass shootings, public concern about the proliferation of firearms has animated a national dialogue about gun control measures, interstate gun trafficking, and whether gun manufacturers should take additional steps to ensure that their products do not end up in the hands of criminals,” the letter says. “Smith & Wesson knows that it is at risk of grave reputational harm.”
Ms. James is opening a new avenue in her fight against gun sellers and makers. Earlier this month, she called on TD Bank, a big lender, to stop financing Smith & Wesson. This summer, she convinced the New York City Employee Retirement System, the city’s largest pension fund, to explore divesting itself of its holdings of gun retailers like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
Smith & Wesson, based in Springfield, Mass., is one of the country’s largest gun makers, and in a securities filing says it makes 50 percent of all the revolvers owned in the United States. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Large United States pension funds have used similar tactics to push big energy companies to disclose more about their climate change-related risks, including spending on Arctic drilling and Canadian oil sands projects. Exxon Mobil is facing new legal challenges by those who argue it should have acted earlier to address the risks of climate change.
Guns could be the next focus of such shareholder efforts, though there were no new gun-related proposals submitted for the 2015 annual shareholder proxies last spring, nor any yet for 2016, according to Institutional Shareholder Services.

A 2014 proposal for the Walmart annual proxy submitted by Trinity Church of New York focused on the retailer’s sale of semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. The S.E.C. allowed Walmart to keep it off its proxy that year. The church sued to keep it in, but lost on appeal and recently withdrew a request to the United States Supreme Court to hear the matter.

By Washington Post staff
December 7, 2023 at 5:00 a.m. EST
A coalition of Catholic nuns has filed a lawsuit against gunmaker Smith & Wesson, calling for the company to stop producing AR-style rifles, which the women claim are “the weapon of choice for numerous mass murderers.”
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a Nevada district court, alleges that Smith & Wesson has repeatedly ignored “red flags” and failed to respond appropriately to mass shootings in the United States. The lawsuit references some of the deadliest mass killings in recent U.S. history — including at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012; a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018; and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., in 2022.
Smith & Wesson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for gunmakers, described the lawsuit as “frivolous” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

“This same group has been filing shareholder proposals and losing so I guess they’re trying a new tactic,” he told the paper.
The nuns, who represent four congregations, said in a joint statement on Tuesday that AR-style rifles “have stolen the lives of so many innocent people and devastated communities across the nation.” They added that, as Smith & Wesson stockholders, they have supported resolutions for the company to explain to shareholders the “exposure to risk and liability” pertaining to its manufacturing of AR-style rifles.
“These rifles have no purpose other than mass murder,” the statement read. “They are not the sporting rifles that members of our own families and other responsible gun owners value.”
Jeffrey Norton, an attorney representing the nuns, said in a statement to The Washington Post that his clients are “activist investors,” meaning they buy stock in a company to pursue a certain goal.

“We are proud to partner with these congregations of Catholic Sisters who have long sought corporate responsibility through their shareholder activism,” Norton said in a news release on Tuesday.

The action is not the first of its kind. In 2018, shareholders, including some faith-based organizations, passed a resolution requiring Smith & Wesson to create a report about how it would address the safety risks its products posed, CNBC reported. Smith & Wesson has also faced several lawsuits from shooting survivors and victims’ families.
Founded in 1852, Smith & Wesson produced pistols, revolvers and other firearms for more than 150 years before it began producing long guns in 2006. The company’s first rifle series debuted in February of that year.
Afterward, Smith & Wesson saw a rise in profits and was “seemingly unfazed by the exponential rise in gun deaths and mass shootings carried out with its product,” the lawsuit alleges. It adds that AR-style rifles were used in mass killings, including in Colorado Springs, Nashville and Uvalde.

Smith & Wesson producing such weapons makes “it more difficult and more dangerous for law enforcement to respond” to mass killings, the lawsuit states, referencing the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, where officers waited more than an hour before entering a classroom to confront the gunman.
The nuns also accuse Smith & Wesson of using “aesthetic marketing,” including advertisements that are geared toward young people “despite the fact that many states impose age restrictions” on purchasing firearms. Smith & Wesson also does not have a system for “tracking injuries and deaths caused by” its rifles, “whether from accidental discharge, product malfunction, or deliberate use,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit calls on Smith & Wesson to revise its policies to protect the company and stockholders “from a repeat of the damaging events.” In their statement Tuesday, the nuns urged Smith & Wesson to return to its production cycle pre-2006 — before it manufactured long guns and “held itself as a successful beacon of responsible gun ownership.”
One of the first pages of the lawsuit is taken up almost entirely by a single photo captured in the aftermath of the attack in the Aurora movie theater.
The image shows the AR-style rifle the gunman used in the attack laying between a pair of bright pink flip flops, the ground splattered with blood.
“It’s horrific,” Norton said in a statement. “That’s the point.”

RETROPOLIS
A gunmaker once tried to reform itself. The NRA nearly destroyed it.

When a horrific school shooting traumatized the public in 1999, the largest gunmaker in the United States promised to reform itself.
Smith & Wesson’s chief executive spoke passionately about the company’s responsibility for what children did with its weapons.
Gun control advocates hoped it was the start of something big.
It was. And something brutal, too.
Child-safe triggers
On April 20, 1999, a teacher and a dozen children were massacred in Littleton, Colo., in the deadliest high school shooting the country had yet seen. A furious public turned on the firearms industry, which looked as weak as it had ever been.

The National Rifle Association’s membership already had been in free-fall through much of the 1990s, including an embarrassing defection by former president George H.W. Bush. Now thousands of protesters surrounded the NRA’s convention, a month after the horror at Columbine High School. They outnumbered gun owners more than 2 to 1, the New York Times reported, and the convention broke up early.

Congress was as reluctant as ever to take up gun control, but activists saw their chance to cripple the firearms industry directly.
Dozens of cities, several states and President Bill Clinton’s White House either sued or threatened to sue large firearms manufacturers by the turn of the 21st century — accusing them of negligent business practices, holding them liable for violence done with their products.
And it worked. On March 17, 2000 — just short of a year after the Columbine massacre — the White House announced a settlement agreement with Smith & Wesson, the oldest and largest gunmaker in the United States.
To escape the lawsuits, Smith & Wesson agreed to a long list of voluntary reforms, including child-safe triggers, the development of “smart guns” that could be fired only by the owner, and a ban on sales to gun dealers linked to crimes and those with loose policies regarding background checks.

Although some gun control activists complained the reforms were minor, the mere fact that Smith & Wesson negotiated with the government was a seismic event in the gun industry.
For decades, the NRA and the gun manufacturers that give the group tens of millions of dollars had been in lock-step opposition to reforms. With rare exceptions such as the 1994 assault weapons ban, Congress’s inaction was no coincidence; the gun lobby was among the country’s most powerful.
The NRA once believed in gun control and had a leader who pushed for it
Now, for the first time, a member of the gun bloc had defected, with signs that more manufacturers could soon follow.
“The agreement marks the first big concession by industry to the mounting public and political pressure for stronger gun controls,” the Times wrote in an editorial. “It also represents a crushing defeat for the National Rifle Association, which has been arguing violently against the very reforms that Smith & Wesson has now agreed to undertake.”
Advertisement
But the gun lobby had not, in fact, been crushed. It was merely cornered.
And Smith & Wesson was about to find out how the NRA fought when its back was to the wall.
‘Sellout’
A few days after Smith & Wesson announced its agreement with the federal government, Glock Inc. announced it was considering joining the settlement.
As the biggest supplier of guns to U.S. law enforcement agencies, Glock was faced not just with lawsuits, but also a potential boycott by the agencies that were its biggest customers. “The industry split caused by Smith & Wesson’s move threatens to grow even wider if Glock agrees to similar terms,” the Los Angeles Times wrote.
The San Jose Mercury News observed that the gun lobby’s “usually impregnable defenses” were finally splintering.
That same week, the NRA launched its first counterattack. It was simply a statement, titled “The Smith & Wesson Sellout.”
Advertisement
“The settlement doesn’t merely alter the design of S & W handguns — it elevates S & W to the role of self-appointed arbiter of national gun policy,” the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action wrote on March 20, 2000.
The NRA accused the gunmaker of “craven self-interest” — a “British-owned company” that had “run up the white flag of surrender and run behind the Clinton-Gore lines, leaving its competitors in the U.S. firearms industry to carry on the fight for the Second Amendment.”
“The true intent of this agreement is to force down the throats of an entire lawful industry anti-gun polices rejected by the Congress, rejected by legislatures across America, and rejected by the judges,” the NRA wrote.
So it became clear: The gun lobby would turn on one of its own before letting it compromise on reforms.
A Georgia Republican’s threat to Delta: Stop boycotting the NRA, or you won’t get your tax break
The NRA did not specifically call for a boycott, but other gun groups quickly organized them. By the end of March, the New York Times wrote, one of the largest gun wholesalers in the country had cut off Smith & Wesson handguns. Retailers had announced their own boycotts, along with countless gun owners.

The company was deluged with angry phone calls and faxes, the Mercury News wrote. Days after the government deal was announced, Smith & Wesson executives were pleading with the company’s  remaining distributors not to abandon it, too.
“If the agreement is what I’ve read so far, I can’t imagine Smith & Wesson being in business at this time next year,” an NRA board member told the newspaper — a quote that came very close to prophesy.
Smith & Wesson vs. the gun industry
At the center of the fury was Smith & Wesson’s chief executive, Ed Shultz. A self described “rabid gun owner,” he now found himself working late at the company’s Nashville office, trying to explain himself to angry emailers.
“I always said, ‘All we have to do is train kids and make sure those guns are locked up,’ ” Shultz told Newsweek.

But in 1998, he recalled, two children with a van full of guns shot five people to death at their middle school in Jonesboro, Ark. — a horror eclipsed the next year by the Columbine massacre.
“I changed,” Shultz told Newsweek, as the Smith & Wesson boycotts entered their third month. “I said, ‘Okay, we have to find another solution.’ … You can’t just say, ‘I made it, I shipped it, it’s out of my hands.’ ”
Store backs away from smart guns following outcry from 2nd Amendment activists
He confessed that the blowback was enormous. “When Shultz and his troops arrive in Charlotte, N.C., for the National Rifle Association’s annual convention,” Newsweek wrote in the spring of 2000, “no one’s quite sure whether they’ll be accosted in the lobby or shunned like a virus.”
The convention that May looked nothing like the dismal showing from the year before. The NRA crowd was energized — defiant in the face of Smith & Wesson’s alleged defection and massive anti-gun protests, including the Million Mom March in Washington that month.
Advertisement
More than 200,000 people had joined the gun group since the settlement was announced, NPR reported. In TV ads, the NRA’s president, Charlton Heston, had been accusing Smith & Wesson’s London-based owner of trying to reinstitute colonial control of the United States, the Mail on Sunday wrote.
The gunmaker’s sales and stocks were plunging, and there was talk that the owner, a huge British conglomerate, was trying to sell Smith & Wesson.
All this was necessary, in the eyes of gun rights advocates who saw themselves in an existential battle.
“Many believe licensing and registration will lead to nothing short of federal confiscation of all their firearms,” an NPR reporter said from the 2000 NRA convention, where boycott signs floated around Smith & Wesson’s booth.
‘My own beliefs’
The federal government tried to protect its only cooperating gunmaker, understanding that unless the rest of the industry joined the settlement deal, Smith & Wesson would either back out of it or go bankrupt.
Advertisement
Clinton’s White House tried the carrot: persuading nearly 200 police agencies to buy guns only from gunmakers that joined the settlement, Newsweek reported.
It tried the stick: threatening a new federal lawsuit against gun manufacturers, which were already battling the cities in court.
But no other manufacturer broke ranks. Glock’s brief consideration of a deal had ended once the NRA spoke out. The company preferred to risk “bleeding to death with legal bills,” an executive told the Mercury News, rather than face what Smith & Wesson was going through.
At one point during the boycotts, the Times wrote, New York, Connecticut and Maryland opened antitrust investigations of the gun industry, suspecting that Smith & Wesson’s competitors were conspiring to organize them. But gunmakers denied any collusion, and the investigation led to no penalties. As the presidential election approached, the industry saw hope that a new administration would back off the pressure.
So in the end, Smith & Wesson fell alone.
In the summer of 2000, the company suspended most of its manufacturing and sent workers home, the AP reported.
In the fall, more than 100 employees were laid off — 15 percent of the workforce.
Shultz stepped down as chief executive and left Smith & Wesson that September.
Even as some accused him of being duped by the government, he was unapologetic about trying to reform the business of guns.
“I had to make those decisions based on the tradition of the company and my own beliefs of what’s right,” Shultz later told the Times. “Would I put locks on our guns if it might save one child? The answer was yes.”
M&P15
In the spring of 2001, a little more than a year after the deal with the government, the British conglomerate sold Smith & Wesson to an American start-up for $15 million — a fraction of the $100-plus million it had paid for the gunmaker in the 1980s, the Los Angeles Times wrote.
Smith & Wesson’s new owner soon paid a visit to the NRA and made peace. “The turnaround was unbelievably dramatic,” a spokesman for the gunmaker later told the AP. “The problems were associated with our former owners.”
President George W. Bush was in the White House by then, and his administration showed no sign of trying to enforce Smith & Wesson’s old settlement deal.
There would be no federal lawsuit against gunmakers. The city lawsuits were already bogged down in court. And within a few years, Congress would pass shield laws protecting gunmakers from being sued.
From that point on, the country’s oldest gunmaker and its most powerful gun rights group rose together.
Gun sales soared after Sept. 11, 2001, as terrorist attacks became the new public trauma.
Two years later, Smith & Wesson had not yet designed any smart guns — but it had a new .50 caliber Magnum that was selling quite well.
The Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and two years later Smith & Wesson introduced its first tactical rifle — modeled on the AR-15, branded the M&P15. Demand for such weapons spiked as President Barack Obama prepared to take office, the Boston Globe wrote, amid fears of a new Democratic crackdown on guns.
The real reason Congress banned assault weapons in 1994 — and why it worked
But the crackdown never came. The NRA eventually gave Smith & Wesson’s new chief executive, James Debney, its “Golden Ring of Freedom Award” — noting that the gunmaker had donated well over $1 million to the group.
“We looked back at the support we had given the NRA over time and decided, really quite honestly, that it wasn’t enough,” Debney was quoted as saying in the news release.
So Smith & Wesson became, once again, a revered and profitable U.S. gunmaker.
On Feb. 14, three educators and 14 children were massacred in Parkland, Fla., in the deadliest high school shooting the United States had yet seen.
Police said the shooter used an M&P15 tactical rifle, made by Smith & Wesson.

CEO of gunmaker Smith & Wesson blames politicians for gun violence

August 16, 2022 at 7:42 p.m. EDT
Amid a congressional investigation into gun manufacturers after back-to-back mass shootings this spring, Smith & Wesson CEO Mark Smith released a defiant statement criticizing politicians and the news media as at fault for violent crime.
In the statement posted Monday on Twitter, he accused “a number of politicians and their lobbying partners in the media” of trying to “disparage” his company and shift blame to gunmakers. Smith, who refused to testify before the House Oversight Committee, said politicians had “vilified, undermined and defunded law enforcement” and “generally promoted a culture of lawlessness,” causing a wave of crime.
“They are the ones to blame for the surge in violence and lawlessness,” Smith wrote.
Homicide rates dropped slightly in the first half of this year compared with 2021, yet they remain nearly 40 percent higher than where they stood before the pandemic, according to a report the Council on Criminal Justice released last month. The think tank also found a sharp decline in the percentage of reported robberies and property crimes.

Gun deaths, however, have spiked. In 2020 and 2021, there were 45,000 such fatalities — the highest number recorded since 1995, The Washington Post reported last month. The increase came as gun purchases also hit record levels.
Mass shootings in which four or more people are killed represent a small fraction of gun violence. They account for fewer than 1 percent of people killed by firearms, The Post reported. Yet such incidents are increasing, and they capture widespread attention because they take a toll on Americans’ psyches, creating fear of being in public places.
Mass violence takes toll on Americans’ psyches
The House Oversight Committee probe into gun manufacturers began in late May, after mass shootings at a Buffalo grocery store and a Uvalde, Tex., elementary school left 31 people dead in less than two weeks. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), the panel’s chairwoman, contacted five companies seeking information about the manufacturing, sale and marketing of AR-15-style weapons used in the two incidents; each gun used in the shootings was purchased legally.

Along with Smith & Wesson, which produced the weapon used at the Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Ill., the businesses under investigation include Daniel Defense, the manufacturer of the rifle used at Robb Elementary in Uvalde and Bushmaster, the maker of the weapon used at a Tops Friendly Markets store in Buffalo. Sig Sauer, which made the gun used at the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, and Sturm, Ruger & Co., which manufactured the one used in a 2017 Sutherland Springs, Tex., massacre are part of the probe as well.

Over the past decade, the five companies made more than $1 billion selling “military-style assault weapons to civilians,” the House committee reported last month.

“The gun industry has flooded our neighborhoods, our schools and even our churches and synagogues with these deadly weapons, and has gotten rich doing it,” Maloney (D-N.Y.) said during a hearing on the issue.
Gunmaker’s Super Bowl stunt sheds light on marketing of ‘America’s rifle’
Chief executives from Daniel Defense and Ruger testified before the committee, defending ownership of military-style firearms and arguing that the focus should be on the shooters rather than the guns.
After Smith’s refusal to appear at the hearing, the House committee subpoenaed documents on Smith & Wesson’s sale and marketing of AR-15-style rifles. In a letter notifying the CEO of the subpoena, Maloney wrote that the company told the committee that it “makes no effort” to track injury, deaths or crimes associated with such weapons.
Smith said in the Monday statement that “certain politicians” were trying to pass laws to restrict the Second Amendment and prohibit “advertising products in a manner designed to remind law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutional right to bear arms in defense of themselves and their families.”
He added: “We will never back down in our defense of the 2nd Amendment.”

CEO of Smith & Wesson owner out after misconduct allegations
American Outdoor Brands says James Debney ‘engaged in conduct inconsistent with a nonfinancial company policy’

The parent of gunmaker Smith & Wesson has replaced its chief executive following misconduct allegations.
American Outdoor Brands, which owns an array of shooting, hunting and outdoor brands, said in a statement Wednesday that its board of directors found that James Debney had “engaged in conduct inconsistent with a nonfinancial company policy.” American Outdoor did not provide specifics about the policy or when the violation allegedly took place, and it did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
“We appreciate James’ contributions toward the growth and development of our company and its infrastructure,” Barry M. Monheit, chairman of the board, said in the statement.

Debney had been at the helm of American Outdoor and its predecessor company since 2011, expanding its portfolio through a slew of acquisitions. The firearms industry’s fortunes are typically a sign of the political climate: Sales surge when consumers fear an administration might usher in stricter gun laws. But revenue has slipped during the Trump era.

Springfield, Mass.-based American Outdoor plans to split into two publicly traded companies later this year, with one focusing on firearms and the other on outdoor goods. In November, American Outdoor announced Debney would lead the outdoor products company after the spinoff.
Investors seemed unfazed by the corporate shake-up. American Outdoor’s stock was down roughly 0.2 percent after Thursday’s open.

American Outdoor named Mark Smith and Brian Murphy as joint CEOs. Smith has been president of the company’s manufacturing services unit while Murphy sat at the top of the outdoor products and accessories division, the company said. After the company splits, Murphy will lead the outdoor business, and Smith will take over the gun operation. American Outdoor said the division is carrying on as planned.

All told, 2019 included a long list of high-profile CEO exits. In November, Steven Easterbrook of McDonald’s was removed as CEO and president after the fast-food giant said he “demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee.” In September, the embattled WeWork co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann stepped down after the company’s valuation plummeted in its attempt to go public. Overstock CEO and founder Patrick Byrne abruptly quit in August after claiming to have been involved in multiple FBI investigations and to have romanced the now-deported, Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina — a flash point in the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election — causing company shares to tank.

The 19-year-old White gunman who killed 10 Black people at a grocery store in Buffalo using a modified Bushmaster XM-15 semiautomatic rifle was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison without parole, providing some sense of justice for the community.
But the city — still reeling from the racist attack — wants more.
Buffalo is suing several gun manufacturers, including Beretta, Smith & Wesson, Glock, Remington and Bushmaster, arguing they have fueled gun violence in the city, endangered the safety and health of the public and “must be held accountable.”
“What happened in this community certainly cries out for sensible gun reform,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters following Payton Gendron’s sentencing.
Buffalo’s lawsuit, filed in December, is one of the first cases of its kind under New York’s 2021 public nuisance gun law, which allows the state and people affected by gun violence to sue gun manufacturers, sellers and distributors for endangering the public’s health and safety — or creating a “public nuisance.”

The new statute and similar laws recently enacted in other states mark the latest round in a long-running battle between gun-control advocates and firearm manufacturers over a 2005 federal law that protects the industry from liability.

And this time, the issue could land before the Supreme Court, according to legal experts, as several Democratic-led states take a more aggressive approach to restricting firearms even after the court acted to expand gun rights last year by striking down a decades-old New York law that limited the ability to carry a handgun outside the home.
“For more than a decade, the court turned away basically every Second Amendment petition that it received,” said Joseph Blocher, a Second Amendment law professor at Duke University. But after last year’s ruling, “it could be that we’re going to be looking at multiple gun cases at the Supreme Court.”
A long journey
Gun control advocates have long sought ways to circumvent the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which passed with bipartisan support in 2005 at a time when several cities, including New Orleans, Chicago and Washington, were filing multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the gun industry for creating a “public nuisance,” charging it was flooding their cities with guns.

The cities argued the gun industry shared responsibility for the violence and sought reimbursement for the millions of dollars spent on medical care, police work and other costs.
After aggressive lobbying from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which was worried the lawsuits would bankrupt the industry, Congress passed the PLCAA. It shields manufacturers and sellers of firearms and ammunition from civil lawsuits “resulting from the misuse of their products by others.”
Historically diverse Supreme Court hears disproportionately from White lawyers
But lawmakers carved out exceptions that Democratic-led states are now trying to utilize in response to the steady stream of gun violence across the country.
Under new laws in New York, New Jersey and Delaware, gun manufacturers, sellers and distributors can be sued for creating a “public nuisance” through improper marketing or sales practices — a strategy the states argue complies with the PLCAA.

Gun-control advocates hope the new laws will reduce the risk of guns falling into the hands of criminals and force gun manufacturers to more diligently monitor the sales of their firearms.
“They know that if the laws are upheld, they are going to face accountability in a way that they have not since the federal immunity law was passed in 2005,” Eric Tirschwell, executive director of gun-control nonprofit Everytown Law, said of gunmakers.
But these state laws are now the subject of a legal campaign by firearm manufacturers.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the gun industry’s trade association, is leading the challenge, arguing the new laws are unconstitutional because they are too vague, regulate transactions that take place outside of the states and are preempted by the 2005 law.

The laws are a “transparent and obvious attempt to circumvent the will of Congress,” said NSSF senior vice president Lawrence Keane.
A New Jersey federal judge sided with the group last month when he blocked the state’s law from being enforced, noting that it “is in direct conflict” with federal law. New Jersey has appealed the ruling.
Meanwhile, the NSSF has appealed the dismissal of its New York lawsuit by a district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. A hearing for the NSSF’s district challenge in Delaware will be held Feb. 28. The group also plans to sue California later this year when its version of the law goes into effect.
Paving the way to the Supreme Court?
Gun-control advocates and legal experts who focus on the Second Amendment said the NSSF’s multistate approach bears all the hallmarks of how a special interest group can maneuver to give itself the best chance to bring a case before the Supreme Court, particularly one that may be viewed favorably by the majority.

The NSSF said its goal is simply to challenge the new laws in every jurisdiction where they are being implemented.
“It’s really that simple. There’s no grand strategy,” Keane said. “We are simply responding to the threat to our industry that is occasioned by these statutes being passed at the behest of these gun-control groups.”
The NRA, which filed a brief in support of the NSSF’s New York challenge, said the same.
“The NRA challenges regulations that are unconstitutional and that strip law-abiding citizens of their ability to exercise their rights,” spokesman Lars Dalseide said in a statement. “We are willing to take these cases to the Supreme Court, and of course, accept any favorable decision by a lower court.”

But gun-control advocates are skeptical the industry is not angling for a date with the Supreme Court.

Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the NSSF and other gun industry groups could be trying to manufacture circuit splits by filing lawsuits across the country.
A circuit split is when two or more appeals courts give conflicting rulings about the same legal issue, and it’s one of the traits justices often look for when deciding whether to accept a case.
“If you’re filing lawsuits across the country, courts are going to come out differently in different places,” she said. This “is a long-game strategy of forcing the court to take up these issues.”
Some experts said whether it’s part of a legal strategy or simply how the legal battle is unfolding on its own, the states and lawsuits involved will put the issue on the Supreme Court’s radar.

If “the New York courts say one thing and the California courts say another thing, then it’s likely that the Supreme Court may want to weigh in to clarify what the scope of PLCAA is,” said Timothy D. Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University.
A lawsuit challenging public nuisance gun laws could reach the Supreme Court in two to four years, said Clark Neily, who served as the co-counsel on the winning side of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), a landmark Supreme Court case that overturned the city’s ban on handguns and expanded the scope of the Second Amendment to include individual rights.
Some gun-control advocates said they will be closely watching Tuesday when the Court hears arguments in a case — Gonzalez v. Google — concerning liability protections for technology companies for any clues on how the justices view the broader issue of liability laws for specific industries.

At issue is whether tech companies should be held legally liable for harmful content their algorithms promote. This suit takes aim at Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from lawsuits over the posts, photos and videos users share on their platforms.
All-star legal lineup
The NSSF has lined up two legal heavyweights with decades of appellate experience in gun rights cases to handle its multistate public nuisance litigation.
The trade association announced in July that it hired Paul Clement and Erin Murphy to manage its appeal to the 2nd Circuit. The pair left Kirkland & Ellis in June over the firm’s decision to stop taking Second Amendment cases after Clement helped secure the victory in last year’s landmark gun rights case — New York State Rifle & Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen — and started their own boutique practice.
Clement is one of the field’s leading Supreme Court litigators, having served as solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration and arguing dozens of cases in private practice. He also has personal and professional ties to some of the justices — he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in 2018. Neil M. Gorsuch called Clement a “dear friend” during his confirmation hearing in 2017.
Former president Donald Trump also named Clement in a list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees during his 2020 presidential campaign.
The NSSF “could hardly do better than having Paul Clement and Erin Murphy as their legal team,” said Blocher. “They have been involved in some of the most prominent gun litigation over the past few years at the Supreme Court and also at the courts of appeal. So, I have to assume that they’re litigating with an eye toward potential Supreme Court review.”
Clement and Murphy did not respond to requests for comment.
The NRA has weakened. But gun rights drive the GOP more than ever.
As the NRA’s stature continues to decline following years of internal division and legal strife, the ascendant NSSF has taken on a more prominent role in lobbying and public policy debates.
But the NRA isn’t sitting the issue out. Former solicitor general Noel Francisco has filed a brief on behalf of the NRA supporting the NSSF’s New York appeal. The Trump-era official is another high-powered lawyer who has argued several times before the Supreme Court and now serves as the head of Jones Day’s Washington office.
Buffalo’s path forward
For now, Buffalo is pressing forward with its suit as its leaders argue that gun restrictions are needed to prevent more shootings and that Gendron’s sentencing cannot be the only repercussion for the slaying that devastated the city.
“I would say that justice was done with a small ‘j’ today. But we still have a big ‘J’ of justice to do,” Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said following the sentencing.

Feeling unwelcome in blue states, gun companies move to red ones
At least 20 manufacturers have shifted operations to states with friendlier attitudes toward firearms

By Todd C. Frankel
August 29, 2022 at 7:00 a.m. EDT
Smith & Wesson CEO Mark Smith was fed up. He was running the largest firearms manufacturer in America, based in Springfield, Mass., where it had been making weapons since 1860, and yet state lawmakers were considering a bill to ban the manufacture of AR-15-style rifles for the civilian market. The proposed law would cripple Smith’s company. Sixty percent of Smith & Wesson’s revenue came from AR-15-style guns.
So after years of flirting with the idea, Smith announced last September that Smith & Wesson was pulling up stakes and moving its headquarters from Massachusetts to Tennessee.
Deciding to leave was “extremely difficult,” Smith told investors, but “we feel that we have been left with no other alternative.”
At least 20 firearms, ammunition and gun accessory companies — including some of the industry’s biggest names, such as Beretta and Remington Arms — have moved headquarters or shifted production from traditionally Democratic blue states to Republican red ones over the past decade, relocating thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment amid the nation’s sharpening divide over guns. The companies were enticed by tax breaks and the promise of cheaper labor. But the biggest factor often was the push for stricter gun laws in many of the Democratic-leaning states.

“They’re going where they’re wanted,” said John Harris, a Nashville attorney and executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association.
The result is a firearms industry that is increasingly rooted in the South and, to a lesser extent, the West, weakening ties to the Northeast that stretch back to the Revolutionary War. The dramatic shift illustrates the economic fallout from political polarization among the states, where laws and attitudes are increasingly diverging on hot-button cultural issues, including abortion rights. It also reveals a growing frustration among some left-leaning lawmakers with a homegrown industry that they see as unwilling to even discuss gun violence.
“This is where we part ways,” said Massachusetts state Rep. Bud Williams (D), whose district includes Smith & Wesson’s historic headquarters. “And I’ve been a big supporter of Smith & Wesson. But there’s too many mass shootings. I’m not going to be silent.”
The departures have come in waves, often prompted by legislative reactions to high-profile mass shootings — first the 2012 school shooting in Newtown Conn., and then the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some states run by Democrats tightened gun laws. Republican states often moved in the opposite direction, sometimes loosening gun restrictions in the wake of mass shootings, studies show.

New gun laws led Beretta USA to move its manufacturing operations from Maryland for Tennessee in 2014. Mossberg shipped its shotgun production from Connecticut to Texas that same year. That’s also when Magpul Industries, among the country’s largest producers of ammunition magazines, left Colorado for Texas and Wyoming.
In 2019, Stag Arms trumpeted its departure of Connecticut for Wyoming.
The next year, gunmaker Kimber Manufacturing fled New York for Alabama.
Last November, two months after Smith & Wesson’s farewell, the owner of Remington Arms, the nation’s oldest gunmaker, revealed it was moving its headquarters from Ilion, N.Y. to LaGrange, Ga., pledging to invest $100 million and hire 856 people in its new home.
“We are very excited to come to Georgia, a state that not only welcomes business but enthusiastically supports and welcomes companies in the firearms industry,” Ken D’Arcy, CEO of Roundhill Group, which owns RemArms, said in a statement. His company bought the Remington rifle brand and several others from Remington Outdoor in a bankruptcy sale.
Companies made more than $1B selling powerful guns to civilians, report says
Republican lawmakers have encouraged gun companies to move and looked to lure them to their own states, viewing it as an opportunity to add jobs and burnish culture war credentials.

Last year, Oklahoma lawmakers launched a study of ways to attract gunmakers to the Sooner state. At the 2022 Shot Show, the firearms industry’s major annual trade show, governors from six states traveled to Las Vegas to sell their communities to the manufacturers of guns, ammunition and accessories. All of them were Republicans.
“These states are openly attracting the industry. Some of them have been very aggressive,” said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group based — as it has been for decades — in Newtown, Conn.
The pitch isn’t only about being a safe haven for gun rights. State officials also dangle economic incentives.
Georgia offered $28 million in grants and tax breaks to Remington for its new headquarters. Wyoming gave at least $8 million in grants to Magpul for its relocation. And Smith & Wesson got a big break on property taxes, along with a $9 million grant. Smith & Wesson’s move is expected to boost the company’s earnings per share by about 10 cents a share annually, according to financial disclosures.

“Whatever motivation they have about guns, they’re also motivated by dollars,” Harris, of the Tennessee firearms group, said of the gun companies.
Remington, Smith & Wesson, Magpul, Stag Arms and Kimber did not respond to a request for comment. Beretta declined to comment. Tennessee economic development officials also declined to comment.
The firearms industry is not a huge part of the overall U.S. economy, but it carries symbolic weight. Guns sit at the center of some of the country’s fiercest cultural fights, such as the reach of constitutional rights and worries about crime and violence.
CEO of gunmaker Smith & Wesson blames politicians for gun violence
These days, the firearms industry is growing rapidly, shaking off years of tepid sales during President Donald Trump’s term. (Gun sales tend to spike under Democratic presidents, when the potential for new gun laws seems greater.)
Americans bought an estimated 19.9 million firearms last year — the second most ever, right behind 2020′s pandemic-fueled record tally of nearly 23 million, according to Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting. Employment at firearms and ammunition companies jumped 28 percent from 2015 to 2021, totaling nearly 170,000 people nationwide, according to NSSF data.

The NSSF and the National Rifle Association have cheered on the gunmakers’ caravan of moving vans, attributing the trend to “anti-Second Amendment sentiment” and a search for friendlier states. An NRA journal called America’s First Freedom described the shift as, “Moving to Freer America.”

But most gunmakers are not abandoning blue states entirely.
Beretta USA, subsidiary of Italian gunmaker Beretta, moved 160 jobs from Prince George’s County’s Accokeek, Md., to Gallatin, Tenn., after Maryland lawmakers in 2014 banned dozens of assault-style weapons, including some made by Beretta.
“Why expand in a place where the people who built the gun couldn’t buy it?” Jeffrey Reh, general counsel for Beretta, said to The Washington Post while the state was debating the gun ban.
The bill passed, and Beretta moved. Its $45 million gun plant in Tennessee now employs about 300 people. And while Beretta’s production and research and development teams work there, the gunmaker’s executives and administrative staff — about 100 people — stayed in Maryland.

A recent search of online job ads showed Beretta had nine openings in Tennessee and five in Maryland.
A city that makes guns confronts its role in the Parkland mass shooting
Smith & Wesson plans to keep 1,000 jobs in Massachusetts even after it moves 550 positions, plus another 200 jobs from around the country, and its headquarters to Tennessee, which is expected to be completed next year.
But the loss has been a blow to Springfield.
The city of 155,000 people is located in the Connecticut River Valley, a region once so stocked with firearms manufacturers that it was known as Gun Valley. Springfield was its unofficial capital, the place where George Washington decided to locate the nation’s first armory. Gun making has long been woven into the city’s story.
Smith & Wesson was among the city’s top employers. It donated to local charities and helped sponsor the annual holiday lights display.

“It’s a pretty significant impact,” Timothy Sheehan, the city’s chief development officer, said of the gunmaker’s departure.
Despite the shared history, the relationship between the company and the city had grown strained recently.
The headquarters and its factory gates were the frequent staging ground for protests. Students and religious groups have picketed outside several times since the 2018 Parkland shooting, when a gunman used a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 students and staff.
Last year, the father of a teen killed in that shooting designed a highway billboard that overlooked the firearms plant. It carried the message: “I can’t turn 21 and enjoy my first legal beer because a Florida teen was allowed to get his first legal AR-15.”
Smith & Wesson has responding by digging in and balking at the suggestion it shares responsibility for how its guns are used. This summer, Smith, the chief executive, refused to join executives from other weapons makers when they testified before a House Oversight Committee looking into the firearms industry. He then issued a statement blaming politicians for gun-related crimes and accused them of trying to shift culpability.
Advertisement
The company used to be more willing to talk about ways it could help reduce gun violence.
In 2000, a year after the school mass shooting in Columbine, Colo., President Bill Clinton’s White House and Smith & Wesson announced a legal settlement that included the gunmaker agreeing to install child-safe triggers and to ban sales to gun dealers with checkered pasts. Other gunmakers considered joining the deal. But facing intense pressure from the NRA and the gun industry, Smith & Wesson eventually backed away from the deal. Its chief executive resigned.
The deal was scrapped.
Massachusetts went on to pass some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Long before the gunmaker’s move to Tennessee, it was illegal for Smith & Wesson to sell its AR-15-style rifles to civilians in its home state.
Last year’s proposed state bill would’ve gone even further and outlawed the manufacture of those rifles.
Sheehan, the city’s chief development officer, said he understood the difficult position that the company was in.
“I can also understand the point — the social point — that the legislation was driving at,” Sheehan said.
“But, in my mind,” he said, “you also need to weigh that with the economic impact.”
The bill didn’t pass.
But Smith & Wesson is not coming back.
Williams, the Springfield representative, was among the bill’s co-sponsors.
He knew what it could do to a company in his own backyard.
And he’d once been a big supporter of Smith & Wesson. It was the kind of place where a local kid could land a good job right out of high school and stay a lifetime. As a city councilman, he’d helped push for the company to get property tax cuts. He’d encouraged police departments to buy Smith & Wesson weapons.
But Williams increasingly took note of the toll of gun violence. It wasn’t just the mass shootings. There were the many smaller shootings that seemed to barely make the news.
Smith & Wesson refused to talk about any of it, he said.
He’d seen enough. It was too much. It didn’t matter anymore to him that this was a hometown company.
“I just felt that with all these shootings,” Williams said, “at some point it’s time to put lives over profit.”
Smith & Wesson is expected to open its headquarters down South next year.
Its new home is in a Tennessee county that a couple of years ago declared itself a Second Amendment “sanctuary,” where local leaders vowed to fight against gun control.

The gun that divides a nation
The AR-15 thrives in times of tension and tragedy. This is how it came to dominate the marketplace – and loom so large in the American psyche.
It is revered as a modern-day musket.
It is reviled as a tool for mass killers.

The AR-15 wasn’t supposed to be a bestseller.
The rugged, powerful weapon was originally designed as a soldiers’ rifle in the late 1950s. “An outstanding weapon with phenomenal lethality,” an internal Pentagon report raved. It soon became standard issue for U.S. troops in the Vietnam War, where the weapon earned a new name: the M16.
But few gunmakers saw a semiautomatic version of the rifle — with its shrouded barrel, pistol grip and jutting ammunition magazine — as a product for ordinary people. It didn’t seem suited for hunting. It seemed like overkill for home defense. Gun executives doubted many buyers would want to spend their money on one.

About the terminology  
The industry’s biggest trade shows banished the AR-15 to the back. The National Rifle Association and other industry allies were focused on promoting traditional rifles and handguns. Most gun owners also shunned the AR-15, dismissing it as a “black rifle” that broke from the typical wood-stocked long guns that were popular at the time.
“We’d have NRA members walk by our booth and give us the finger,” said Randy Luth, the founder of gunmaker DPMS, one of the earliest companies to market AR-15s.
Today, the AR-15 is the best-selling rifle in the United States, industry figures indicate. About 1 in 20 U.S. adults — or roughly 16 million people — own at least one AR-15, according to polling data from The Washington Post and Ipsos.
Almost every major gunmaker now produces its own version of the weapon. The modern AR-15 dominates the walls and websites of gun dealers.

The AR-15 has gained a polarizing hold on the American imagination. Its unmistakable silhouette is used as a political statement emblazoned on T-shirts and banners and, among a handful of conservative members of Congress, on silver lapel pins. One Republican lawmaker, Rep. Barry Moore of Alabama, introduced a bill in February to declare the AR-15 the “National Gun of America.”
It also has become a stark symbol of the nation’s gun violence epidemic. Ten of the 17 deadliest U.S. mass shootings since 2012 have involved AR-15s.

This transformation — from made-for-combat weapon to mass-market behemoth and cultural flash point — is the product of a sustained and intentional effort that has forged an American icon.
A Washington Post investigation found that the AR-15’s rise to dominance over the past two decades was sparked by a dramatic reversal in strategy by the country’s biggest gun companies to invest in a product that many in the industry saw as anathema to their culture and traditions.
The Post review — based on interviews with 16 current and former industry executives, some of them talking publicly in depth for the first time, along with internal documents and public filings that describe the changes in previously unknown detail — found that the U.S. firearms industry came to embrace the gun’s political and cultural significance as a marketing advantage as it grasped for new revenue.
The shift began after the 2004 expiration of a federal assault weapons ban that had blocked the sales of many semiautomatic rifles. A handful of manufacturers saw a chance to ride a post-9/11 surge in military glorification while also stoking a desire among new gun owners to personalize their weapons with tactical accessories.
“We made it look cool,” Luth said. “The same reason you buy a Corvette.”
Through it all, even after repeated mass killings involving the AR-15 that accounted for some of the nation’s darkest moments, efforts in Congress to resurrect an assault weapons ban repeatedly fizzled.
Calls by Democratic politicians to renew the ban fell short, with some in their own party voting against it at key moments. Almost no Republican would even entertain the idea. President Donald Trump briefly considered pushing for a ban, asking aides at one point why anyone needed an AR-15, but backed away after advisers warned he would anger his base as well as the NRA.
“The protection of the AR-15 has become the number one priority for the gun lobby,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a vocal supporter of stronger gun laws. He added: “It makes it harder to push this issue on the table because the gun lobby does so much messaging around it.”
Free from congressional scrutiny, the AR-15 has become a consumer product like none other — a barometer of fear and a gauge of political identity, its market success driven by the divisions it sows.

While handguns are involved in the bulk of U.S. gun homicides — responsible for 90 percent of the deaths in cases where details are available, compared to less than 5 percent for rifles, the FBI says — AR-15 sales jump the most with each school shooting and contentious presidential campaign.
They soared in the run-up to the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and after the mass killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, and again ahead of the turbulent 2020 presidential election.
Today, the industry estimates that at least 20 million AR-15s are stored and stashed across the country.
More than 13.7 million of those have been manufactured by U.S. gunmakers just since the Newtown massacre in late 2012, with those sales generating roughly $11 billion in revenue, according to a Post analysis of industry estimates through 2020, the most recently available data. In other words, at least two-thirds of these guns have been made in just the past decade.
Supporters of the AR-15 say its popularity reflects its legitimacy as a tool for law-abiding people. “This firearm is lawfully owned by millions of Americans — used in shooting competitions, for recreational purposes, hunting and home protection,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.
Others say this was not the original idea behind the gun.
Eugene Stoner, a World War II veteran who invented the AR-15 in the late 1950s while working at Armalite, a small engineering firm in Hollywood, had no interest in civilians using his invention, said C. Reed Knight, who owns a Florida gunmaking company and considers Stoner his mentor.
“He looked at this thing as only for the military side of the house,” Knight said. Stoner, who died in 1997, thought his invention was past its prime by the mid-1990s, Knight said. He added that Stoner would have been horrified by the idea that “he invented the tool of all this carnage in the schools.”
Harry Falber, a former executive at Smith & Wesson, one of the country’s best-known firearms brands, saw how Stoner’s invention changed the gun industry. The AR-15’s success came at a huge price, he said.
“The firearms industry, in the aggregate, is very small,” Falber told The Post. “And look at the havoc it wreaks.”
A firearm initially unintended for civilians

Smith & Wesson made its name with handguns, such as Dirty Harry’s “Feeling Lucky?” six-shooter.
The company had never mass-produced a rifle in its storied history stretching to 1852.
That began to change in 2005.
It was a tough time for the firearms industry. Gun sales had been flat for several years, according to federal background check data, the best available proxy for the number of firearms sold. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shows that American gunmakers produced fewer pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns in 2005 than they had five years earlier.
At Smith & Wesson, executives were looking around for new lines of business when, corporate filings show, a company survey detected strong consumer interest in one gun it didn’t make: a tactical rifle.
“The long gun market is a terrific opportunity,” Michael Golden, then the company’s chief executive, told financial analysts in August 2005.
And the power of the Smith & Wesson brand meant “we have got one foot in the door,” he said.
Neither Smith & Wesson nor Golden, who is no longer with the company, responded to multiple requests for comment.
The market for tactical rifles, such as the AR-15, was still largely untapped. None of the big gunmakers made one.

Designed around the Pentagon’s desire for a lightweight weapon to match Soviet rifles such as the AK-47, the AR-15 fired small bullets at very fast speeds. The higher velocity meant the tiny projectiles became unstable when they penetrated a human body, tumbling through flesh to create devastating wounds. But the real innovation was the addition of a small tube to redirect the gas from fired cartridges. This dampened recoil, making it easier to keep steady aim on a target.
The U.S. military started using the rifle during the Vietnam War, with Colt — which had acquired the gun’s patent rights from Armalite — winning the contract to produce the M16. The new gun was met by complaints that it was prone to jamming, even mid-firefight, until Colt revamped the design. Despite its mixed success, the new gun won over military leaders.
Colt held exclusive rights to the semiautomatic, civilian version of the AR-15 until 1977, when the patent expired. Then, other gunmakers could make and sell AR-15s of their own.
Most in the gun industry remained wary. For decades, the AR-15 was regarded as an outsider. Then came the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
As the U.S. military was sent to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, gunmakers looked to play off the conflict-zone images of soldiers in tactical gear holding M16 and M4 carbine rifles. The next best thing for civilians was buying an AR-15.

“There has never been a better accidental advertising campaign in history,” said Doug Painter, a former president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a firearms industry lobbying group.
Smith & Wesson’s first AR-15 was unveiled to the public in February 2006 at the industry’s marquee annual convention, the Shot Show in Las Vegas. It was called the M&P 15.
While the name indicated the gun was for professionals — “M” for military and “P” for police — the company always had its eyes on the consumer market, according to corporate filings and statements from executives. Golden told financial analysts a few months after the M&P 15’s debut that “our intent when we launched the new tactical rifle was to first penetrate the consumer market.”
Many gun company executives saw military and police sales as less profitable, due to lower prices and precise specifications, according to documents and interviews. But they were still important because of the “halo effect,” as a 2009 document prepared for Smith & Wesson called it, in which buyers would be attracted to what they saw professionals using.
The consumer “does pay attention to that,” a Smith & Wesson executive at the time, James Debney, would later explain to financial analysts in 2016.

The M&P 15 was a hit. Smith & Wesson reported revenue from this line of tactical rifles more than quintupled in the gun’s first five full years on the market — from $12.8 million to $75.1 million.
Other big gunmakers soon followed Smith & Wesson’s lead.
New Hampshire-based Sig Arms, later renamed Sig Sauer, said in late 2006 that it planned to make an AR-15 — soon after the firm had been “about two seconds away from imploding,” chief executive Ron Cohen later told Management Today.
The new rifle was credited with helping save the company. Sig Sauer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Wall Street noticed the sales blitz, too.
A private equity firm called Cerberus Capital Management had rolled up several gunmakers into a single conglomerate called Freedom Group. In late 2007, it purchased AR-15 maker DPMS, which was bringing in nearly $100 million in annual sales, said Luth, its founder.
“They saw the AR-15 as the cash cow, which it was,” Luth said.
The change in attitudes toward the AR-15 occurred with “mind-boggling” speed, recalled Ryan Busse, who wrote about his turn from gun industry executive to critic in his 2021 book “Gunfight.”
The AR-15 was suddenly being celebrated after years of being widely viewed with suspicion, Busse said. Gunmakers were no longer avoiding the gun that many had once regarded as the kind of weapon that society would disdain.
He recalled the pressure within the industry to either get on board with the AR-15 or keep quiet. In 2007, prominent hunting writer and TV host Jim Zumbo lost his industry jobs after calling for a ban on hunting with AR-15s. His fate became a watchword: Cross the AR-15 and you might get Zumboed. Zumbo did not respond to requests for comment.
“Nobody thought AR-15s were a good idea just a couple years ago,” Busse said. “And then you couldn’t criticize them without getting fired.”
A marketplace and rebrand for the AR-15

In 2008, economic crisis and political upheaval bolstered the AR-15’s market appeal, according to several industry insiders, as the stock market collapsed under the weight of soured mortgage securities and the country elected its first Black president, a Democrat portrayed by conservatives as an anti-gun radical.
Obama’s victory created an opening for pro-gun groups to tease the potential for a new assault weapons ban — a claim that industry executives have credited with energizing AR-15 sales.
In 2008, when growing demand led U.S. gunmakers to increase production of all firearms by 15 percent, AR-15 production rose by 65 percent, according to government and industry figures. These AR-15s were rapidly becoming a larger share of the overall firearms market — reaching 10 percent of all guns made that year for the first time.
Jeff Buchanan, then-chief financial officer at Smith & Wesson, recalled several years later at a business conference that Obama spurred sales “because he was a pronounced liberal” and “people buy because they are afraid of future legislation.”

That same year, in what many industry insiders saw as a watershed moment, another legendary American gunmaker, Ruger, entered the AR-15 market with its SR-556. The Southport, Conn.-based company had a reputation for high-end firearms. Its corporate motto was “Arms Makers for Responsible Citizens.”
Michael Fifer, the gunmaker’s CEO at the time, described to financial analysts in 2009 how Ruger brought in roughly $200 from each handgun — but each AR-15-style rifle brought in $1,000.
“That’s kind of a 5-to-1 ratio there,” Fifer said.
Ruger declined to comment through its general counsel.
AR-15 fans saw Ruger’s new rifle as validation of a once-taboo gun.
“There is no better illustration for this change than the Evil Black Rifle itself which has just joined the Ruger product offering,” Steve Johnson wrote on his popular Firearm Blog, using a sarcastic name popular with gun owners for AR-15s.
Getting comfortable with the AR-15, industry allies worked to soften the image of the “black rifle.”
NSSF executives recalled in interviews with The Post that they bemoaned that the public mistakenly thought the “AR” stood for “assault rifle.”
“We should not cede the rhetorical high ground to our political enemies,” Larry Keane, the NSSF’s general counsel, recalled saying during a 2009 meeting.
They brainstormed ways to rebrand the gun and win over traditional hunters.
“I just said, ‘It’s a modern sporting rifle,’” recalled Painter, then the NSSF president. “And there the phrase stuck.”
The NSSF just needed to persuade others to use the term, which it shortened to “MSR.”
Glenn Sapir, then the NSSF’s director of editorial services, recalled that executives pressed gunmakers and industry publications to adopt the name. It slowly began popping up in gun magazines and catalogues. Companies used it during earnings calls. Gun owners were given pocket fact cards with the preferred talking points.

How the AR-15 became America’s gun
At a school in Nashville on Monday, a shooter used two AR-style weapons and a handgun to kill three children and three adults. Today on “Post Reports,” we look at the history of the AR-15 and how it became America’s gun.
A four-page ad from the NSSF’s foundation spelled out the campaign.
“Some hunters look askance at AR-style rifles, and that’s understandable,” read the ad in the November 2009 issue of Outdoor Life magazine. “They don’t look like any type of rifle they, their dads or granddads ever carried into the woods. Looks can be deceiving, however, and in the case of AR-platform rifles, they certainly are.”
Some AR-15 supporters saw the MSR campaign as a phony attempt to make the black rifle seem less ominous — even though what many loved most about it was the threatening look.
“The true AR enthusiasts, they kind of saw through it,” Luth said. “It stuck, but not with the true believers.”
How gunmakers craft ‘realistic’ gaming experiences

Video games introduced a new generation to the AR-15 through popular first-person shooter games such as “Call of Duty.” Players got to simulate using military weapons with down-to-the-bolt realism.
The firearms industry was eager to help out.
In 2010, representatives of two gun manufacturers and a video game maker converged at an outdoor shooting range north of Las Vegas. Employees from two Freedom Group subsidiaries deployed a stockpile of weapons, including AR-15s, while technicians from Infinity Ward, developer of “Call of Duty,” carefully recorded the sounds, according to participants. Infinity Ward’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, declined to comment.
No detail, even the click of inserting a magazine, was too small to capture, participants said.
“We went through all the guns slowly and methodically, shooting until they got the quality sound they needed,” recalled Cory Weisnicht, who was an employee with a Freedom Group company tasked with firing the guns at the Clark County Shooting Complex.
The meeting reflected a move by some gunmakers at the time to strike licensing agreements with gaming firms to feature certain firearms, according to lawyers and experts, along with interviews and documents obtained by The Post.
“We wanted the brand exposure,” said a former employee of a Freedom Group subsidiary familiar with the Las Vegas meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company strategy.
The push for realism in shooting video games was influential for some buyers, retailers said. Many gun owners bought real-world versions of the firearms they used online, said Lucas Botkin, founder of the gun gear outfitter T.Rex Arms. And they could accessorize their guns in the same way.
Botkin recalled how he fixed up his first AR-15.
“I built it out very similarly to what I had in ‘Modern Warfare,’” he said, referring to the M4 in a game in the Call of Duty series. “It was my reference point.”

The AR-15 also was winning over new fans in other ways.
In the Philadelphia suburbs, Bill Shanley saw his first AR-15 up close when one of his adult sons came home with one in 2010. Shanley was in his mid-50s and had been raised around guns. He’d taught his own children how to shoot, too. But he’d never given much thought to the AR-15.
“It never would’ve occurred to me to get a gun like that,” Shanley recalled.
Father and son took the AR-15 to a gun range. Shanley couldn’t believe how loud it was, even with ear protection, the sound crashing off the range overhang. But the black rifle had little recoil. It was fun to shoot. Three shots with his old hunting rifle bruised his shoulder. Fifty rounds with the AR-15 felt like a breeze. Shanley was sold. He soon bought his own, a Smith & Wesson M&P 15.

The AR-15 changed Shanley’s thinking about these kinds of weapons. Now, he saw them as no different from the traditional firearms owned by his great-grandfather or the shotgun his uncle gave him when he was a teenager. His dad used to keep a shotgun at home for protection. Shanley, a manufacturing sales manager, started keeping an AR-15 in his bedroom.
“The AR is the modern-day musket,” he said.
An uneasiness over AR-15 marketing

Harry Falber knew little about the gun world when he joined Smith & Wesson, first as a consultant and then as head of licensing at the gunmaker’s headquarters in Springfield, Mass.
But he knew how to sell big consumer brands after years of working on ads at Volvo, Polaroid and Hallmark.
“A consumer wants to be identified with the product they are using, and a gun is no different,” said Falber, speaking publicly in detail about his tenure at Smith & Wesson for the first time.
Falber thought Smith & Wesson’s line of M&P firearms was “a brilliant marketing name.” And he loved Smith & Wesson’s strong reputation and long history.
But he said he struggled with how to sell a military weapon to civilians.
“I didn’t care what you did with it,” he said. “It was still a black gun.”
In late 2010, after he had been with the company for about a year, Falber commissioned a study comparing two Smith & Wesson ads that had recently appeared in Guns & Ammo magazine, according to internal documents obtained by The Post.
One showed Falber’s vision for selling guns. It featured a silver revolver and a black pistol, side by side against the light backdrop of a range target, under the block type “FINE-TUNED MACHINES.”
The other ad showed what looked like a police SWAT team officer, with dark gloves and tactical helmet, pointing an AR-15 at some unseen target in the distance. “THE CHOSEN ONE,” it read.
Consumers gave higher scores to the “FINE-TUNED MACHINES” ad, according to the report, which recommended that future ads be tested “to maximize message, positive image, and consumer motivation.”
Falber thought he had won the argument. He wanted to stress craftsmanship.
But Smith & Wesson went in the direction of “THE CHOSEN ONE.”
“They went full-bore into a dark, dark milieu,” Falber said.
In 2010, one Smith & Wesson ad focused on craftsmanship, while another ad had a military and police theme. (Images obtained by The Washington Post)
Smith & Wesson was not alone in adopting messages that made Falber uneasy.
Bushmaster was running ads for its AR-15 with the line “CONSIDER YOUR MAN CARD REISSUED.” Daniel Defense posted social media ads showing its AR-15 with a helmeted soldier in a war zone under “USE WHAT THEY USE.”
“It was just appealing to the worst levels of what you can conjure up in someone’s mind,” Falber said. “And we’d been nurturing this.”
Daniel Defense declined to comment.
By 2011, the AR-15 and similar firearms enjoyed warm welcomes at the gun industry’s biggest events. They were the stars. Half the exhibition space at the annual Shot Show was now occupied by AR-15 gunmakers and tactical-equipment makers — even as the convention itself had doubled in size to 500,000 square feet, said Painter, the former NSSF president.
Every exhibitor clamored to be next to the big rifles because that’s where the crowds were.
“The best analogy is the AR rifle was like the kids who wore their baseball hats turned around,” Painter said. “It wasn’t cool until suddenly it became cool.”

But Falber wanted out.
“I just couldn’t stomach driving up there anymore,” he said.
In 2012, he quit Smith & Wesson.
The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary came two months later.
A little after 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2012, a man used a Bushmaster AR-15 to shoot his way into the school in Newtown. The gunman fired 154 rounds in minutes, striking children who were just 6 and 7 years old multiple times, according to a Connecticut state’s attorney’s report. Twenty children and six school employees were killed.
Falber lived 20 miles from Newtown. His wife worked in education. He could imagine the scene inside. He was in disbelief. He took no comfort in the fact that the rifle used in the massacre was made by Bushmaster and not Smith & Wesson.
“It ripped me apart,” he said.
Mass killings, politics fuel division on AR-15

The deadliest mass killing at a K-12 school in U.S. history focused attention like never before on the destructive power of the AR-15.
With Newtown, the weapon so meticulously marketed as a “sporting rifle” had been used as a killing machine that destroyed the bodies of young victims.
Cerberus, the private equity giant, soon announced plans to sell off Freedom Group — the conglomerate it had assembled as a big bet on the AR-15’s success and the owner of the Bushmaster brand. Cerberus declined to comment. One of its companies at the time owned Bushmaster, maker of the weapon used in the shooting, which would eventually defend its firearms advertising as lawful in a lawsuit filed by Newtown families alleging the gunmaker’s marketing was aimed at troubled young men.
Dick’s Sporting Goods immediately stopped selling AR-15s at its flagship stores during what the company called “this time of national mourning.”
Collaboration between gunmakers and the gaming industry also came to a quick end, said Glen Schofield, co-director of “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.”
“We all kind of want to leave that era behind us,” he said. “Every time there was a mass shooting we got blamed.”
Days after the shooting, Obama called for new gun laws, citing public support for banning “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. But any notion that the tragedy in Newtown would compel the politically influential NRA to compromise evaporated a week later. Wayne LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, unveiled a school security plan that boiled down to his mantra of “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

NRA leaders feared there would be momentum for a ban, and they even huddled with companies and lobbyists to begin plotting strategy, former officials said.
But the focus on banning the AR-15 only made the gun more popular with firearms enthusiasts, NRA leaders later said.
“People who never planned to buy one went out and got one,” said Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist who was on the NRA board. “It was an f-you to the left.”
David Keene, who was the NRA’s president at the time, said that was the moment gun rights became a top issue for Republicans — with the AR-15 at the center.
“It became a political symbol,” said Keene, who also served as the longtime chairman of the American Conservative Union.
The NRA’s embrace of the AR-15 was also practical, said Joshua Powell, a former longtime NRA adviser and chief of staff to LaPierre. NRA membership numbers were declining, but AR-15 owners remained loyal. Powell said the organization wanted the rifle to be viewed as “America’s gun.”
“The heart and soul of the NRA membership was hardcore AR folks,” Powell said.
The move to defend the AR-15 was off-putting to some NRA members, such as John Goodwin, who worked as an NRA lobbyist in the late 2000s and now belongs to a gun safety advocacy group called 97Percent. Discussions about the AR-15 sounded nothing like how he talked about the shotgun he used for bird hunting.
“They make it sound like the AR-15 is a religious relic,” Goodwin said.
The AR-15’s resilience post-Newtown was clear weeks later when the organizer of a major gun event in Harrisburg, Pa., the Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show, was forced to cancel amid the backlash from its decision to ban displays of the weapon.
“We’re not going to go into business with people saying you can’t have this gun or that gun,” Tommy Millner, CEO of the outdoor retailing giant Cabela’s at the time, recalled saying when he pulled the company’s sponsorship.
Any push for a new assault weapons ban seemed destined to fail in Congress. And gun sales were soaring again.
In December 2012, the same month as the Newtown shooting, monthly gun background checks hit what at the time was an all-time high of 2.8 million and stayed elevated for months.
Stores were picked clean of their AR-15 inventory. Prices jumped.
While the government doesn’t break out AR-15 sales, the industry group NSSF estimated that companies produced at least 3.2 million AR-15s firearms in 2012 and 2013 alone — more than they’d made in the entire previous decade.
When a new assault weapons ban finally came to a vote in the Democratic-led Senate soon after Newtown, it didn’t come close to passing — earning just 40 votes.
Just one Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, voted in favor. But even more galling to gun-control advocates was that just 38 of the chamber’s 54 Democrats voted in favor.
After Congress failed to act, a handful of states, such as Connecticut, New York and Maryland, moved to pass their own assault weapons bans.
A firearm at the center of rallies, protests and ads

In March 2013, C.J. Grisham, then an Army master sergeant, decided to sling an AR-15 over his shoulder and take a walk with his son along a dirt road in tiny Temple, Tex. He wasn’t breaking the law, but a police officer stopped him.
“Some reason why you have this?” the officer asked, grabbing the rifle.
“’Cause I can,” Grisham said.
The officer drew his pistol and pinned Grisham to the hood.
The encounter ended peacefully, but it was caught on video and posted online. Almost overnight, Grisham, who was later convicted of misdemeanor police interference, became the face of a movement.
“It wasn’t that I was carrying a rifle,” recalled Grisham, a former member of the Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violence. “It was the fact I was carrying that rifle.”
Grisham went on to create Open Carry Texas, a group advocating for carrying weapons in public. Open-carry demonstrations had been cropping up in conservative states since the 2008 election, typically with holstered pistols, but Grisham’s group pushed a new tactic. Its members made a show of carrying hunting rifles, shotguns and AR-15s as they visited places like Sonic, Chipotle and Home Depot.

Even the NRA was uneasy about the brash, public displays. It called the Texas protests “downright weird.” But so many gun owners sided with Grisham that the NRA quickly flip-flopped, saying its original opposition had been a mistake.
It became increasingly common to see people openly armed with black rifles at protests and political rallies — their AR-15s gripped in their hands or slung over their shoulders. The practice would take off on the far right, as armed demonstrators would play a prominent role in white-supremacist gatherings such as the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, as well as protests in 2020 against pandemic restrictions and counterdemonstrations against racial justice activists.
The AR-15 seemed to be everywhere. Its cultural profile was rising, not unlike the way the Soviet-made Kalashnikov became a symbol of insurgency and freedom for many around the world.
Companies such as Black Rifle Coffee Co. launched. Youth baseball teams ran AR-15 raffles as fundraisers. Companies offered free AR-15s with a new roof or new car, like banks giving away toasters for new checking accounts.
More political candidates were displaying AR-15s in campaign ads, too — and not just conservatives looking to impress their base. Jason Kander, an Army veteran and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, put out a 2016 campaign ad that showed him assembling an AR-15 while blindfolded. Kander did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2016, amid rising political tensions with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump vying for the White House, the U.S. gun industry reported that it had crossed an important threshold: It produced more than 2 million AR-15s for the first time, 63 percent more than were manufactured the year before, according to NSSF estimates.
The AR-15 had truly entered the mainstream.
America’s angst with the AR-15

Manny Oliver tended to view guns like an outsider.
Ever since moving to Florida from his native Venezuela years ago, Oliver had noticed how people in his new home tied guns to notions of freedom and patriotism.
“In America, they treat guns like they are their salvation,” Oliver said.
He didn’t understand it. But like many people, he didn’t feel the need to.
By 2018, he and his wife, Patricia, had settled near Parkland, Fla., an affluent suburb outside Fort Lauderdale. Gun violence rarely intruded, except when mass shootings made the news. Oliver recalled talking with his teenage son, Joaquin, about the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, where a gunman with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people. And Joaquin had been rattled by the 2017 Las Vegas shooting — where a gunman used an arsenal that included AR-15s to kill 60 people — because his mom had been there on a business trip just a week earlier.
It seemed so random, Oliver said.
Four months later, on Valentine’s Day 2018, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland armed with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 and killed 17 people. Joaquin, 17, died after being shot multiple times, according to testimony at the gunman’s trial.
The shooting ignited a new kind of anti-gun activism that was intensely personal, such as the student-led March for Our Lives that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters to the National Mall a month later. They were grieving. And they were angry.

“I refused to think this is a normal thing that happens,” Oliver said.
He and his wife founded a gun violence prevention group called Change the Ref and focused on attention-grabbing projects such as renting a billboard outside Smith & Wesson’s headquarters in Massachusetts with a picture of their son.
The Parkland shooting also highlighted America’s growing unease with the AR-15.
Kroger raised the minimum age to buy guns and ammunition from 18 to 21. Walmart — which had quietly stopped selling AR-15s three years earlier, in 2015 — did the same.
Top NRA officials worked to persuade other retailers, such as Bass Pro Shops, not to pull AR-15s from their shelves, according to Powell, the group’s former chief of staff.
“The gun folks will go nuts against you, and it’s going to be incredibly bad for business, and it’s going to get you a lot of bad press,” Powell recalled NRA officials telling Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris. In other cases, Powell warned there would be NRA member boycotts.
Morris backed down, Powell said. “He understood who his customers were.”
A representative for Bass Pro Shops said Morris had no “recollection” of the conversation. “Decisions on the products and services we offer have always been based on customer preferences in compliance with all federal, state and local laws,” the spokesman said.
Unable to just move on, the shooting forced Oliver and his wife to reinvent their lives.
“We are not searching for happiness,” he said. “I don’t think we’re ever going to be happy.”
An uptick in shootings and a stalemate on gun control

Shortly after Parkland, President Donald Trump repeatedly floated the idea of supporting a new assault weapons ban.
He mentioned it on live television to one of the Senate’s most vocal gun-control backers, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and in a private meeting with Parkland families. His comments rattled NRA officials and some of his own advisers.
NRA representatives later warned Trump against taking action. “They came up here and said to him, the base is going to blow you up,” according to a former official who sat in during a series of meetings with the NRA. They, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions.
But Trump kept coming back to the idea, according to several former administration officials.
In the summer of 2019, after back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso involving an AR-15-style pistol and an AKM-style rifle, Trump told aides that he wanted to ban AR-15s, according to people present for the statements.
“I don’t know why anyone needs an AR-15,” Trump told aides as he flew on Marine One to the White House in August 2019, according to a person who heard his comments.
As one former official put it in describing the real estate developer turned politician, “His reflexes were a New York liberal on guns. He doesn’t have knee-jerk conservative reflexes.”
But Trump was also petrified of the NRA and others taking him on, former advisers said, and heard from a number of advisers that it would be unpopular. Trump ultimately stopped entertaining the idea of working with Democrats on gun control later that year, when he was caught in a scandal over his now-infamous phone call with Ukraine’s president.
“F--- it, I’m not going to work with them on anything. They’re f---ing impeaching me,” Trump said in one Oval Office meeting, according to a participant.
Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesman, did not respond to detailed findings in this article but said that “there had been no bigger defender of the Second Amendment than President Trump.” He said that Trump had offered other proposals after mass shootings, such as adding security guards to schools and allowing teachers who are licensed to carry a weapon to do so.
Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut and a participant in a White House meeting on a potential ban, described Trump’s lack of action as a missed opportunity for an unusually powerful Republican leader. “I said this to Trump in that meeting: I think the Republican Party would have followed him wherever he went, and he ultimately decided to stand with the NRA,” Murphy said.
But, Murphy said, the burst of post-Parkland activism transformed gun politics among Democrats. Many in the party, he said, started to see gun control as a cause that could energize their core voters — rather than fearing it as one that would rile up the right.
“For whatever reason those kids finally shamed the Democratic Party into running on this issue,” Murphy said.
Several months after the Parkland shooting, one of the Democrats who had voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013 in the wake of Newtown announced he had changed his mind.
Sen. Mark R. Warner, who earned the NRA’s support as Virginia’s governor in the mid-2000s, represented a state that was now trending more liberal. He would go on to co-sponsor new proposed assault weapons bans in the Senate.
“While I was far from the deciding vote,” Warner wrote of the post-Newtown legislation in a 2018 op-ed in The Post, “I have nevertheless wrestled with that ‘no’ vote ever since.” Despite his own role in helping to defeat the ban, Warner described Congress’s failure to act as part of a “sad pattern of dysfunction.”
The AR-15, however, was about to reach new heights of popularity.

In 2020, a year of pandemic lockdowns, racial justice protests and a bitterly fought presidential campaign, U.S. gunmakers produced about 2.5 million AR-15s, according to the NSSF. That added up to roughly 1 in 4 of all guns that ATF said were manufactured in the United States.
Helped by its line of M&P 15 rifles, Smith & Wesson saw its sales nearly double to a record $1.1 billion, according to financial filings. CEO Mark Smith described it as “the most successful year in the 169-year history of the company.”
One Smith & Wesson M&P 15 sold in 2020 ended up in the hands of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two people and wounded a third during that summer’s racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wis.
Rittenhouse, later found not guilty based on claims of self-defense, explained during his trial why he chose an AR-15: “I thought it looked cool.” Rittenhouse could not be reached for comment.
The AR-15 was also especially alluring to the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in May 2022.
“The AR-15 and its variants are very deadly when used properly,” he wrote in a manifesto filled with hateful vitriol. “Which is the reason I picked one.”
Ten days later, 19 schoolchildren and two adults were shot to death in Uvalde, Tex., with another AR-15, the Daniel Defense DDM4.
The string of attacks prompted President Biden, who as a senator had strongly supported the 1994 assault weapons ban, to promise a renewed effort to stop the sale of military-style weapons.
“For God’s sake, how much more carnage are we willing to accept?” Biden said in June.
Then, a gunman with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 killed seven people at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Ill.
Later that month, executives from five gunmakers were called to Capitol Hill to answer questions about AR-15s. The hearing played out in expected fashion. Democrats decried the gunmakers, the Republicans defended them, and the gun executives deflected.
“A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil,” said Christopher Killoy, chief executive at Ruger.
Smith & Wesson’s chief executive refused to show up.
A House Oversight report produced for the hearing spotlighted the money earned by the gun industry, saying that Ruger’s gross earnings from AR-15 rifles nearly tripled from 2019 to 2021 to more than $103 million.
Two days later, the Democratic-led House passed a new assault weapons ban on a tight party-line vote of 217-213 — the first time the measure had been voted on in nearly three decades. But the Senate, also run by Democrats, never took action.
Amid the growing scrutiny, Smith & Wesson chief executive Mark Smith put out a statement claiming his company’s guns were not responsible for any crimes, but politicians and the media “are the ones to blame for the surge in violence and lawlessness.”
Smith’s comment was a revealing reminder of just how much the firearms industry had changed — from defender of a gun culture familiar to many Americans to a mass producer and leading champion of AR-15s.
That new legacy permeated this year’s Shot Show, held in January in Las Vegas.
At the same event two decades ago, AR-15s were shown only in restricted areas in the back.
This year, Smith & Wesson’s sprawling exhibit was surrounded by other gunmakers offering their own AR-15s, such as Mossberg, Black Rain Ordnance and Savage Arms. Smith & Wesson promoted its latest addition to its AR-15 lineup: the M&P Volunteer.
The closed-door trade event was open only to people with industry ties. But photographs and video reviewed by The Post showed racks of matte black Volunteer rifles in different configurations, such as the M&P 15 Volunteer XV Pro, with a suggested retail price of $1,569.
Back home in Connecticut, Falber, the former marketing executive, still admired the “M&P” name. But “Volunteer” felt different to him. He shrugged off the suggestion that it was just a nod to Smith & Wesson’s decision to begin moving its headquarters from liberal Massachusetts to conservative Tennessee, whose nickname is the Volunteer State.
Putting that name on such a powerful rifle evoked scenes of armed civilian patrols along the country’s southern border and at racial justice protests, Falber said.
Maybe, he said, it will help Smith & Wesson sell the AR-15. “But,” he added, “how many more guns can they possibly sell?”

Highland Park victims try Sandy Hook legal strategy: Sue the gunmaker

Survivors and families of those killed and wounded in a shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill., are suing the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack and two gun stores that they say helped the gunman carry out the massacre.
The suit against Smith & Wesson follows a similar one by families of victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which ended with Remington Arms, the maker of the AR-15-style rifle used in the killings, agreeing to pay $73 million in February.
The group of survivors is also suing Robert E. Crimo III, the man charged in connection with the shooting in a Chicago suburb, which killed seven and injured more than 40, according to court records filed Tuesday in Lake County Circuit Court. Crimo faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Also named in the lawsuit are his father Robert Crimo Jr. who allegedly helped his son legally obtain the assault rifle used in the rampage, along with gun stores Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms.
Attorneys representing the families filed a set of 10 civil complaints alleging negligence, aiding and abetting, battery and assault following a shooting they say was “foreseeable” and “entirely preventable.”
“The community in and around Highland Park has been devastated by this tragic shooting and too many lives have been lost or forever changed,” Antonio M. Romanucci, one of the lawyers representing survivors, said in a news release. “Parents and grandparents lost their lives while simply trying to spend time with their families, others were shot and seriously wounded, including one young boy who has paid the highest price and will never ride his bike or run again.”

A representative with Smith & Wesson did not immediately respond to a message from The Washington Post. Bud’s Gun Shop, an online gun distributor, also did not respond to a message when reached by The Post. A man who answered the phone of Illinois gun shop Red Dot Arms and who declined to identify himself when reached by The Post said the store “had no comment.”
A public defender representing Crimo, who has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail, could not be immediately reached by The Post. George Gomez, an attorney for his father, declined to comment when reached by The Post.
As Highland Park heads back to school, scars of July 4th shooting remain
The attorneys representing the families of three of those killed in the Highland Park shooting and dozens of injured allege the “shooter was the type of a young consumer susceptible to Smith & Wesson’s deceptive and unfair marketing, and was enabled by his father.” The lawsuits also allege that both gun stores, Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms, negligently and illegally sold the weapon used during the attack, an M&P15 assault rifle.

“The use of a Smith & Wesson M&P15 for this nefarious purpose was predictable and preventable and there must be accountability for the corporate decisions that incubated this tragedy, clearly dismissing public safety while bringing in record earnings. With this litigation we intend to end the Smith & Wesson manipulation of consumers,” Romanucci said in the news release.
According to the complaints, Smith & Wesson deceptively markets its M&P rifles line as if it were approved and/or used by the U.S. military, an unfair practice “particularly effective with young men fascinated with militaristic combat missions.”
The lawsuits also claim Bud’s Gun Shop sold the assault rifle to the gunman although it is illegal for Highwood and Highland Park residents to buy and possess assault weapons. Bud’s Gun Shop later shipped the rifle to Red Dot Arms, the gun dealer in Illinois, which the lawsuit alleges illegally gave the shooter access to the weapon. According to the complaints, both stores knew that they were selling an assault rifle to a resident of a municipality where possession is not allowed by law because they were aware of his address, but still went forward with the sales.

Synagogue shooting victims can sue gunmaker Smith & Wesson, California judge rules

The survivors and families of victims of a shooting at a California synagogue in 2019 may proceed with a lawsuit filed against the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack, as well as the gun store that sold it, after a ruling issued by a San Diego judge last week.
San Diego County Superior Court Judge Kenneth J. Medel dismissed manufacturer Smith & Wesson’s assertion that the lawsuit was barred under a law that protects gunmakers from some liability when their products are used for crimes. In a ruling released Wednesday, Medel said the lawsuit demonstrated sufficient negligence on the part of Smith & Wesson in marketing the gun, an assault-style semiautomatic rifle that can be modified to fire automatically.
On April 27, 2019, the last day of Passover, John Earnest allegedly opened fire on members of the Chabad of Poway synagogue. The shooting left Poway resident Lori Kaye, 60, dead, and three injured, including a rabbi and an 8-year-old. Earnest, described in the ruling as “bent on waging war on the worshippers and exterminating the Jewish people,” used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle during the attack, police said.

Earnest faces state and federal prosecution on charges of murder and hate crimes, and for alleged civil rights violations.
The lawsuit says Smith & Wesson designed the M&P 15, similar to the popular AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, so it could be easily modified to fire automatically. The lawsuit also says the company used marketing on social media and in advertising, “through videogame-like commercials despite the known risks that young people in that demographic are highly susceptible to that type of advertising and have disproportionately perpetrated mass shooting using similar firearms.”
In addition to naming Smith & Wesson, the ruling says San Diego Guns, the store where Earnest purchased the rifle, can now be sued by the plaintiffs. Earnest was 19 at the time of the shooting and did not have a hunting license exempting him from California’s minimum age of 21 for owning long guns such as the M&P 15.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), signed into law in 2005, shields gunmakers from litigation when the weapons they produce are used in criminal acts. It does not, however, apply in cases of negligence or deliberate violations of state laws.

Last week’s ruling is the latest instance of gunmakers facing potential liability when their products are used in large-scale violence. In 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the manufacturer of the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle used in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School could be sued by the families of the victims. Twenty-six people died in that attack, including 20 children.
The Las Vegas shooter modified a dozen rifles to shoot like automatic weapons
In April, 2020, a federal judge in Nevada ruled that the manufacturers of the weapons used in the 2017 Route 91 Harvest Musical Festival shooting in Las Vegas would have to face a wrongful-death claim brought by one of the 58 people who died. In that ruling, U.S. District Judge Andrew P. Gordon wrote that the family of Carrie Parsons had shown that “the defendant’s AR-15s could be easily modified with bump stocks to shoot automatically, which the shooter did with tragic results. So the [Parsonses] have sufficiently alleged causation.” Gordon ruled that the PLCAA did not bar the wrongful-death claim and referred the case to the Nevada Supreme Court.

Jonathan Lowy, chief counsel for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said on the Brady Campaign website: “Today’s judgment is a victory, and an important step on the road to justice for the victims of the shooting at Chabad of Poway Synagogue, and all Americans who believe that the gun industry is not above the law. We look forward to proving our case in court, and working to prevent future tragedies.”

Companies made more than $1B selling powerful guns to civilians, report says
House oversight committee accused gun manufacturers of “manipulative marketing campaigns” and profiting off violence.

July 27, 2022 at 7:19 p.m. EDT
Five gun companies made more than $1 billion over the last decade selling powerful “military-style assault weapons to civilians,” with their revenue surging amid an increase in firearm violence nationwide, a House committee reported on Wednesday.
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform assailed the gun companies, saying they deployed “manipulative marketing campaigns” that sought to connect masculinity with purchasing rifles. Some of the gun manufacturers have seen revenue more than double or triple in recent years, the committee said.
“The gun industry has flooded our neighborhoods, our schools and even our churches and synagogues with these deadly weapons, and has gotten rich doing it,” House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) said during a hearing on the issue Wednesday.
The staggering scope of U.S. gun deaths goes far beyond mass shootings
The committee, which said it had studied manufacturers that sold AR-15-style weapons used in mass killings, released its findings after a string of such shootings, including this year in Highland Park, Ill.; Uvalde, Tex.; and Buffalo. Mass killings account for a small share of overall gun violence in the United States; both have increased in recent years.

Appearing before the committee on Capitol Hill, chief executives from two of the companies defended their products as well as ownership of such powerful rifles. The core issue, they said, was not the guns themselves, but the people who might use them to inflict mass carnage.

“Mass shootings were all but unheard of just a few decades ago,” said Marty Daniel, chief executive of Daniel Defense, the gunmaker that produced the weapons used in the Uvalde elementary school massacre, which killed 19 children and two teachers, and a deadly attack in Las Vegas in 2017 that killed 60 people. “So what changed? Not the firearms.”
“I believe our nation’s response needs to focus not on the type of gun, but on the type of persons who are likely to commit mass shootings,” Daniel said. He called the massacres in Uvalde, Buffalo and Highland Park “pure evil” and “unfathomable.”
Gunmaker’s Super Bowl stunt sheds light on marketing of ‘America’s rifle’
The other companies named in the report were Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, and Sturm, Ruger & Co. Christopher Killoy, president and chief executive of Ruger, also appeared at the hearing Wednesday, and he acknowledged “tension between our constitutional right to own firearms and the harm inflicted by criminals who acquire them.”

But, he said, the latter should not prevent people from exercising the former.
“We firmly believe that it is wrong to deprive citizens of their constitutional right to purchase the lawful firearm they desire because of the criminal acts of wicked people,” Killoy said. “A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil. The difference is in the intent of the individual possessing it, which we respectfully submit should be the focus of any investigation into the root causes of criminal violence involving firearms.”
Deadly gun violence has surged across the country, with fatal shootings nationwide spiking in 2020 and 2021 to the highest levels in a quarter-century. At the same time, Americans have bought a flood of new guns, with more than 43 million firearms purchased over those years, according to a Washington Post analysis.
Chicago homicides over July 4 weekend eclipsed the grim toll in Highland Park
Even as the testimony was unfolding in Washington, communities across the country were still confronting the aftermath of recent mass shootings. The gunman accused of opening fire in Highland Park earlier this month, killing seven people during an Independence Day parade, was indicted Wednesday on 117 counts by a grand jury, including charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and aggravated battery.

And in South Florida, a jury continued to hear testimony in a trial meant to determine whether a gunman who killed 17 people in a Parkland, Fla., high school in 2018 should be sentenced to death.
The House committee launched its investigation into gun manufacturers in May, following the back-to-back killings in Uvalde and Buffalo, which galvanized enough public response to fuel the passage of modest gun-control legislation for the first time in decades.
How the Senate's gun deal came together after a 30-year logjam
Maloney pointed to the committee’s findings in criticizing the gun companies for how they promoted guns, which she said “includes marketing to children, preying on young men’s insecurities and even appealing to violent white supremacists.”
Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the committee’s ranking Republican, spoke skeptically of laws that limit firearms ownership and pushed back on criticism of the gun companies.

“Gun manufacturers do not cause violent crime,” he said. “Criminals cause violent crime.”
Gun companies, he said, sell firearms to people “allowed to exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for their protection and other lawful purposes.”
The committee had also asked the gunmakers to provide information about efforts to track deaths and injuries caused by their AR-15-style weapons. All five of the gunmakers told the committee they don’t do that.
But others have tried. In 2018, a group of investors in Ruger pushed the company to report on the violence associated with its guns. The board of directors objected. But a majority of shareholders — led by a group of nuns, and supported by Ruger’s largest investor at the time, the asset firm Blackrock — passed the proposal. The vote occurred just a few months after the Parkland massacre.

The following year, Ruger grudgingly produced the report, which was criticized by activists for failing to include adequate details. The company said monitoring the criminal use of its products “is not feasible.” In June, a majority of shareholders approved a new resolution asking the company to study the deadliness of its products and impact on human rights.

A coalition of Catholic nuns has filed a lawsuit against gunmaker Smith & Wesson, calling for the company to stop producing AR-style rifles, which the women claim are “the weapon of choice for numerous mass murderers.”
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a Nevada district court, alleges that Smith & Wesson has repeatedly ignored “red flags” and failed to respond appropriately to mass shootings in the United States. The lawsuit references some of the deadliest mass killings in recent U.S. history — including at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012; a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018; and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., in 2022.
Smith & Wesson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for gunmakers, described the lawsuit as “frivolous” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

“This same group has been filing shareholder proposals and losing so I guess they’re trying a new tactic,” he told the paper.
The nuns, who represent four congregations, said in a joint statement on Tuesday that AR-style rifles “have stolen the lives of so many innocent people and devastated communities across the nation.” They added that, as Smith & Wesson stockholders, they have supported resolutions for the company to explain to shareholders the “exposure to risk and liability” pertaining to its manufacturing of AR-style rifles.
“These rifles have no purpose other than mass murder,” the statement read. “They are not the sporting rifles that members of our own families and other responsible gun owners value.”
Jeffrey Norton, an attorney representing the nuns, said in a statement to The Washington Post that his clients are “activist investors,” meaning they buy stock in a company to pursue a certain goal.

“We are proud to partner with these congregations of Catholic Sisters who have long sought corporate responsibility through their shareholder activism,” Norton said in a news release on Tuesday.

The action is not the first of its kind. In 2018, shareholders, including some faith-based organizations, passed a resolution requiring Smith & Wesson to create a report about how it would address the safety risks its products posed, CNBC reported. Smith & Wesson has also faced several lawsuits from shooting survivors and victims’ families.
Founded in 1852, Smith & Wesson produced pistols, revolvers and other firearms for more than 150 years before it began producing long guns in 2006. The company’s first rifle series debuted in February of that year.
Afterward, Smith & Wesson saw a rise in profits and was “seemingly unfazed by the exponential rise in gun deaths and mass shootings carried out with its product,” the lawsuit alleges. It adds that AR-style rifles were used in mass killings, including in Colorado Springs, Nashville and Uvalde.

Smith & Wesson producing such weapons makes “it more difficult and more dangerous for law enforcement to respond” to mass killings, the lawsuit states, referencing the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, where officers waited more than an hour before entering a classroom to confront the gunman.
The nuns also accuse Smith & Wesson of using “aesthetic marketing,” including advertisements that are geared toward young people “despite the fact that many states impose age restrictions” on purchasing firearms. Smith & Wesson also does not have a system for “tracking injuries and deaths caused by” its rifles, “whether from accidental discharge, product malfunction, or deliberate use,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit calls on Smith & Wesson to revise its policies to protect the company and stockholders “from a repeat of the damaging events.” In their statement Tuesday, the nuns urged Smith & Wesson to return to its production cycle pre-2006 — before it manufactured long guns and “held itself as a successful beacon of responsible gun ownership.”
One of the first pages of the lawsuit is taken up almost entirely by a single photo captured in the aftermath of the attack in the Aurora movie theater.
The image shows the AR-style rifle the gunman used in the attack laying between a pair of bright pink flip flops, the ground splattered with blood.
“It’s horrific,” Norton said in a statement. “That’s the point.”

A gunmaker once tried to reform itself. The NRA nearly destroyed it.

When a horrific school shooting traumatized the public in 1999, the largest gunmaker in the United States promised to reform itself.
Smith & Wesson’s chief executive spoke passionately about the company’s responsibility for what children did with its weapons.
Gun control advocates hoped it was the start of something big.
It was. And something brutal, too.
Child-safe triggers
On April 20, 1999, a teacher and a dozen children were massacred in Littleton, Colo., in the deadliest high school shooting the country had yet seen. A furious public turned on the firearms industry, which looked as weak as it had ever been.

The National Rifle Association’s membership already had been in free-fall through much of the 1990s, including an embarrassing defection by former president George H.W. Bush. Now thousands of protesters surrounded the NRA’s convention, a month after the horror at Columbine High School. They outnumbered gun owners more than 2 to 1, the New York Times reported, and the convention broke up early.

Congress was as reluctant as ever to take up gun control, but activists saw their chance to cripple the firearms industry directly.
Dozens of cities, several states and President Bill Clinton’s White House either sued or threatened to sue large firearms manufacturers by the turn of the 21st century — accusing them of negligent business practices, holding them liable for violence done with their products.
And it worked. On March 17, 2000 — just short of a year after the Columbine massacre — the White House announced a settlement agreement with Smith & Wesson, the oldest and largest gunmaker in the United States.
To escape the lawsuits, Smith & Wesson agreed to a long list of voluntary reforms, including child-safe triggers, the development of “smart guns” that could be fired only by the owner, and a ban on sales to gun dealers linked to crimes and those with loose policies regarding background checks.

Although some gun control activists complained the reforms were minor, the mere fact that Smith & Wesson negotiated with the government was a seismic event in the gun industry.
For decades, the NRA and the gun manufacturers that give the group tens of millions of dollars had been in lock-step opposition to reforms. With rare exceptions such as the 1994 assault weapons ban, Congress’s inaction was no coincidence; the gun lobby was among the country’s most powerful.
The NRA once believed in gun control and had a leader who pushed for it
Now, for the first time, a member of the gun bloc had defected, with signs that more manufacturers could soon follow.
“The agreement marks the first big concession by industry to the mounting public and political pressure for stronger gun controls,” the Times wrote in an editorial. “It also represents a crushing defeat for the National Rifle Association, which has been arguing violently against the very reforms that Smith & Wesson has now agreed to undertake.”

But the gun lobby had not, in fact, been crushed. It was merely cornered.
And Smith & Wesson was about to find out how the NRA fought when its back was to the wall.
‘Sellout’
A few days after Smith & Wesson announced its agreement with the federal government, Glock Inc. announced it was considering joining the settlement.
As the biggest supplier of guns to U.S. law enforcement agencies, Glock was faced not just with lawsuits, but also a potential boycott by the agencies that were its biggest customers. “The industry split caused by Smith & Wesson’s move threatens to grow even wider if Glock agrees to similar terms,” the Los Angeles Times wrote.
The San Jose Mercury News observed that the gun lobby’s “usually impregnable defenses” were finally splintering.
That same week, the NRA launched its first counterattack. It was simply a statement, titled “The Smith & Wesson Sellout.”

“The settlement doesn’t merely alter the design of S & W handguns — it elevates S & W to the role of self-appointed arbiter of national gun policy,” the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action wrote on March 20, 2000.
The NRA accused the gunmaker of “craven self-interest” — a “British-owned company” that had “run up the white flag of surrender and run behind the Clinton-Gore lines, leaving its competitors in the U.S. firearms industry to carry on the fight for the Second Amendment.”
“The true intent of this agreement is to force down the throats of an entire lawful industry anti-gun polices rejected by the Congress, rejected by legislatures across America, and rejected by the judges,” the NRA wrote.
So it became clear: The gun lobby would turn on one of its own before letting it compromise on reforms.

The NRA did not specifically call for a boycott, but other gun groups quickly organized them. By the end of March, the New York Times wrote, one of the largest gun wholesalers in the country had cut off Smith & Wesson handguns. Retailers had announced their own boycotts, along with countless gun owners.

The company was deluged with angry phone calls and faxes, the Mercury News wrote. Days after the government deal was announced, Smith & Wesson executives were pleading with the company’s  remaining distributors not to abandon it, too.
“If the agreement is what I’ve read so far, I can’t imagine Smith & Wesson being in business at this time next year,” an NRA board member told the newspaper — a quote that came very close to prophesy.
Smith & Wesson vs. the gun industry
At the center of the fury was Smith & Wesson’s chief executive, Ed Shultz. A self described “rabid gun owner,” he now found himself working late at the company’s Nashville office, trying to explain himself to angry emailers.
“I always said, ‘All we have to do is train kids and make sure those guns are locked up,’ ” Shultz told Newsweek.
Advertisement
But in 1998, he recalled, two children with a van full of guns shot five people to death at their middle school in Jonesboro, Ark. — a horror eclipsed the next year by the Columbine massacre.
“I changed,” Shultz told Newsweek, as the Smith & Wesson boycotts entered their third month. “I said, ‘Okay, we have to find another solution.’ … You can’t just say, ‘I made it, I shipped it, it’s out of my hands.’ ”
Store backs away from smart guns following outcry from 2nd Amendment activists
He confessed that the blowback was enormous. “When Shultz and his troops arrive in Charlotte, N.C., for the National Rifle Association’s annual convention,” Newsweek wrote in the spring of 2000, “no one’s quite sure whether they’ll be accosted in the lobby or shunned like a virus.”
The convention that May looked nothing like the dismal showing from the year before. The NRA crowd was energized — defiant in the face of Smith & Wesson’s alleged defection and massive anti-gun protests, including the Million Mom March in Washington that month.

More than 200,000 people had joined the gun group since the settlement was announced, NPR reported. In TV ads, the NRA’s president, Charlton Heston, had been accusing Smith & Wesson’s London-based owner of trying to reinstitute colonial control of the United States, the Mail on Sunday wrote.
The gunmaker’s sales and stocks were plunging, and there was talk that the owner, a huge British conglomerate, was trying to sell Smith & Wesson.
All this was necessary, in the eyes of gun rights advocates who saw themselves in an existential battle.
“Many believe licensing and registration will lead to nothing short of federal confiscation of all their firearms,” an NPR reporter said from the 2000 NRA convention, where boycott signs floated around Smith & Wesson’s booth.
‘My own beliefs’
The federal government tried to protect its only cooperating gunmaker, understanding that unless the rest of the industry joined the settlement deal, Smith & Wesson would either back out of it or go bankrupt.
Advertisement
Clinton’s White House tried the carrot: persuading nearly 200 police agencies to buy guns only from gunmakers that joined the settlement, Newsweek reported.
It tried the stick: threatening a new federal lawsuit against gun manufacturers, which were already battling the cities in court.
But no other manufacturer broke ranks. Glock’s brief consideration of a deal had ended once the NRA spoke out. The company preferred to risk “bleeding to death with legal bills,” an executive told the Mercury News, rather than face what Smith & Wesson was going through.
At one point during the boycotts, the Times wrote, New York, Connecticut and Maryland opened antitrust investigations of the gun industry, suspecting that Smith & Wesson’s competitors were conspiring to organize them. But gunmakers denied any collusion, and the investigation led to no penalties. As the presidential election approached, the industry saw hope that a new administration would back off the pressure.
So in the end, Smith & Wesson fell alone.
In the summer of 2000, the company suspended most of its manufacturing and sent workers home, the AP reported.
In the fall, more than 100 employees were laid off — 15 percent of the workforce.
Shultz stepped down as chief executive and left Smith & Wesson that September.
Even as some accused him of being duped by the government, he was unapologetic about trying to reform the business of guns.
“I had to make those decisions based on the tradition of the company and my own beliefs of what’s right,” Shultz later told the Times. “Would I put locks on our guns if it might save one child? The answer was yes.”
M&P15
In the spring of 2001, a little more than a year after the deal with the government, the British conglomerate sold Smith & Wesson to an American start-up for $15 million — a fraction of the $100-plus million it had paid for the gunmaker in the 1980s, the Los Angeles Times wrote.
Smith & Wesson’s new owner soon paid a visit to the NRA and made peace. “The turnaround was unbelievably dramatic,” a spokesman for the gunmaker later told the AP. “The problems were associated with our former owners.”
President George W. Bush was in the White House by then, and his administration showed no sign of trying to enforce Smith & Wesson’s old settlement deal.
There would be no federal lawsuit against gunmakers. The city lawsuits were already bogged down in court. And within a few years, Congress would pass shield laws protecting gunmakers from being sued.
From that point on, the country’s oldest gunmaker and its most powerful gun rights group rose together.
Gun sales soared after Sept. 11, 2001, as terrorist attacks became the new public trauma.
Two years later, Smith & Wesson had not yet designed any smart guns — but it had a new .50 caliber Magnum that was selling quite well.
The Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and two years later Smith & Wesson introduced its first tactical rifle — modeled on the AR-15, branded the M&P15. Demand for such weapons spiked as President Barack Obama prepared to take office, the Boston Globe wrote, amid fears of a new Democratic crackdown on guns.
The real reason Congress banned assault weapons in 1994 — and why it worked
But the crackdown never came. The NRA eventually gave Smith & Wesson’s new chief executive, James Debney, its “Golden Ring of Freedom Award” — noting that the gunmaker had donated well over $1 million to the group.
“We looked back at the support we had given the NRA over time and decided, really quite honestly, that it wasn’t enough,” Debney was quoted as saying in the news release.
So Smith & Wesson became, once again, a revered and profitable U.S. gunmaker.
On Feb. 14, three educators and 14 children were massacred in Parkland, Fla., in the deadliest high school shooting the United States had yet seen.
Police said the shooter used an M&P15 tactical rifle, made by Smith & Wesson.

CEO of gunmaker Smith & Wesson blames politicians for gun violence

Amid a congressional investigation into gun manufacturers after back-to-back mass shootings this spring, Smith & Wesson CEO Mark Smith released a defiant statement criticizing politicians and the news media as at fault for violent crime.
In the statement posted Monday on Twitter, he accused “a number of politicians and their lobbying partners in the media” of trying to “disparage” his company and shift blame to gunmakers. Smith, who refused to testify before the House Oversight Committee, said politicians had “vilified, undermined and defunded law enforcement” and “generally promoted a culture of lawlessness,” causing a wave of crime.
“They are the ones to blame for the surge in violence and lawlessness,” Smith wrote.
Homicide rates dropped slightly in the first half of this year compared with 2021, yet they remain nearly 40 percent higher than where they stood before the pandemic, according to a report the Council on Criminal Justice released last month. The think tank also found a sharp decline in the percentage of reported robberies and property crimes.

Gun deaths, however, have spiked. In 2020 and 2021, there were 45,000 such fatalities — the highest number recorded since 1995, The Washington Post reported last month. The increase came as gun purchases also hit record levels.
Mass shootings in which four or more people are killed represent a small fraction of gun violence. They account for fewer than 1 percent of people killed by firearms, The Post reported. Yet such incidents are increasing, and they capture widespread attention because they take a toll on Americans’ psyches, creating fear of being in public places.
Mass violence takes toll on Americans’ psyches
The House Oversight Committee probe into gun manufacturers began in late May, after mass shootings at a Buffalo grocery store and a Uvalde, Tex., elementary school left 31 people dead in less than two weeks. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), the panel’s chairwoman, contacted five companies seeking information about the manufacturing, sale and marketing of AR-15-style weapons used in the two incidents; each gun used in the shootings was purchased legally.

Along with Smith & Wesson, which produced the weapon used at the Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Ill., the businesses under investigation include Daniel Defense, the manufacturer of the rifle used at Robb Elementary in Uvalde and Bushmaster, the maker of the weapon used at a Tops Friendly Markets store in Buffalo. Sig Sauer, which made the gun used at the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, and Sturm, Ruger & Co., which manufactured the one used in a 2017 Sutherland Springs, Tex., massacre are part of the probe as well.

Over the past decade, the five companies made more than $1 billion selling “military-style assault weapons to civilians,” the House committee reported last month.

“The gun industry has flooded our neighborhoods, our schools and even our churches and synagogues with these deadly weapons, and has gotten rich doing it,” Maloney (D-N.Y.) said during a hearing on the issue.
Gunmaker’s Super Bowl stunt sheds light on marketing of ‘America’s rifle’
Chief executives from Daniel Defense and Ruger testified before the committee, defending ownership of military-style firearms and arguing that the focus should be on the shooters rather than the guns.
After Smith’s refusal to appear at the hearing, the House committee subpoenaed documents on Smith & Wesson’s sale and marketing of AR-15-style rifles. In a letter notifying the CEO of the subpoena, Maloney wrote that the company told the committee that it “makes no effort” to track injury, deaths or crimes associated with such weapons.
Smith said in the Monday statement that “certain politicians” were trying to pass laws to restrict the Second Amendment and prohibit “advertising products in a manner designed to remind law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutional right to bear arms in defense of themselves and their families.”
He added: “We will never back down in our defense of the 2nd Amendment.”

CEO of Smith & Wesson owner out after misconduct allegations

The parent of gunmaker Smith & Wesson has replaced its chief executive following misconduct allegations.
American Outdoor Brands, which owns an array of shooting, hunting and outdoor brands, said in a statement Wednesday that its board of directors found that James Debney had “engaged in conduct inconsistent with a nonfinancial company policy.” American Outdoor did not provide specifics about the policy or when the violation allegedly took place, and it did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
“We appreciate James’ contributions toward the growth and development of our company and its infrastructure,” Barry M. Monheit, chairman of the board, said in the statement.

Debney had been at the helm of American Outdoor and its predecessor company since 2011, expanding its portfolio through a slew of acquisitions. The firearms industry’s fortunes are typically a sign of the political climate: Sales surge when consumers fear an administration might usher in stricter gun laws. But revenue has slipped during the Trump era.

Springfield, Mass.-based American Outdoor plans to split into two publicly traded companies later this year, with one focusing on firearms and the other on outdoor goods. In November, American Outdoor announced Debney would lead the outdoor products company after the spinoff.
Investors seemed unfazed by the corporate shake-up. American Outdoor’s stock was down roughly 0.2 percent after Thursday’s open.

American Outdoor named Mark Smith and Brian Murphy as joint CEOs. Smith has been president of the company’s manufacturing services unit while Murphy sat at the top of the outdoor products and accessories division, the company said. After the company splits, Murphy will lead the outdoor business, and Smith will take over the gun operation. American Outdoor said the division is carrying on as planned.

All told, 2019 included a long list of high-profile CEO exits. In November, Steven Easterbrook of McDonald’s was removed as CEO and president after the fast-food giant said he “demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee.” In September, the embattled WeWork co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann stepped down after the company’s valuation plummeted in its attempt to go public. Overstock CEO and founder Patrick Byrne abruptly quit in August after claiming to have been involved in multiple FBI investigations and to have romanced the now-deported, Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina — a flash point in the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election — causing company shares to tank.

The 19-year-old White gunman who killed 10 Black people at a grocery store in Buffalo using a modified Bushmaster XM-15 semiautomatic rifle was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison without parole, providing some sense of justice for the community.
But the city — still reeling from the racist attack — wants more.
Buffalo is suing several gun manufacturers, including Beretta, Smith & Wesson, Glock, Remington and Bushmaster, arguing they have fueled gun violence in the city, endangered the safety and health of the public and “must be held accountable.”
“What happened in this community certainly cries out for sensible gun reform,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters following Payton Gendron’s sentencing.
Buffalo’s lawsuit, filed in December, is one of the first cases of its kind under New York’s 2021 public nuisance gun law, which allows the state and people affected by gun violence to sue gun manufacturers, sellers and distributors for endangering the public’s health and safety — or creating a “public nuisance.”

The new statute and similar laws recently enacted in other states mark the latest round in a long-running battle between gun-control advocates and firearm manufacturers over a 2005 federal law that protects the industry from liability.

And this time, the issue could land before the Supreme Court, according to legal experts, as several Democratic-led states take a more aggressive approach to restricting firearms even after the court acted to expand gun rights last year by striking down a decades-old New York law that limited the ability to carry a handgun outside the home.
“For more than a decade, the court turned away basically every Second Amendment petition that it received,” said Joseph Blocher, a Second Amendment law professor at Duke University. But after last year’s ruling, “it could be that we’re going to be looking at multiple gun cases at the Supreme Court.”
A long journey
Gun control advocates have long sought ways to circumvent the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which passed with bipartisan support in 2005 at a time when several cities, including New Orleans, Chicago and Washington, were filing multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the gun industry for creating a “public nuisance,” charging it was flooding their cities with guns.

The cities argued the gun industry shared responsibility for the violence and sought reimbursement for the millions of dollars spent on medical care, police work and other costs.
After aggressive lobbying from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which was worried the lawsuits would bankrupt the industry, Congress passed the PLCAA. It shields manufacturers and sellers of firearms and ammunition from civil lawsuits “resulting from the misuse of their products by others.”
Historically diverse Supreme Court hears disproportionately from White lawyers
But lawmakers carved out exceptions that Democratic-led states are now trying to utilize in response to the steady stream of gun violence across the country.
Under new laws in New York, New Jersey and Delaware, gun manufacturers, sellers and distributors can be sued for creating a “public nuisance” through improper marketing or sales practices — a strategy the states argue complies with the PLCAA.
Advertisement
Gun-control advocates hope the new laws will reduce the risk of guns falling into the hands of criminals and force gun manufacturers to more diligently monitor the sales of their firearms.
“They know that if the laws are upheld, they are going to face accountability in a way that they have not since the federal immunity law was passed in 2005,” Eric Tirschwell, executive director of gun-control nonprofit Everytown Law, said of gunmakers.
But these state laws are now the subject of a legal campaign by firearm manufacturers.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the gun industry’s trade association, is leading the challenge, arguing the new laws are unconstitutional because they are too vague, regulate transactions that take place outside of the states and are preempted by the 2005 law.

The laws are a “transparent and obvious attempt to circumvent the will of Congress,” said NSSF senior vice president Lawrence Keane.
A New Jersey federal judge sided with the group last month when he blocked the state’s law from being enforced, noting that it “is in direct conflict” with federal law. New Jersey has appealed the ruling.
Meanwhile, the NSSF has appealed the dismissal of its New York lawsuit by a district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. A hearing for the NSSF’s district challenge in Delaware will be held Feb. 28. The group also plans to sue California later this year when its version of the law goes into effect.
Paving the way to the Supreme Court?
Gun-control advocates and legal experts who focus on the Second Amendment said the NSSF’s multistate approach bears all the hallmarks of how a special interest group can maneuver to give itself the best chance to bring a case before the Supreme Court, particularly one that may be viewed favorably by the majority.

The NSSF said its goal is simply to challenge the new laws in every jurisdiction where they are being implemented.
“It’s really that simple. There’s no grand strategy,” Keane said. “We are simply responding to the threat to our industry that is occasioned by these statutes being passed at the behest of these gun-control groups.”
The NRA, which filed a brief in support of the NSSF’s New York challenge, said the same.
“The NRA challenges regulations that are unconstitutional and that strip law-abiding citizens of their ability to exercise their rights,” spokesman Lars Dalseide said in a statement. “We are willing to take these cases to the Supreme Court, and of course, accept any favorable decision by a lower court.”

But gun-control advocates are skeptical the industry is not angling for a date with the Supreme Court.

Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the NSSF and other gun industry groups could be trying to manufacture circuit splits by filing lawsuits across the country.
A circuit split is when two or more appeals courts give conflicting rulings about the same legal issue, and it’s one of the traits justices often look for when deciding whether to accept a case.
“If you’re filing lawsuits across the country, courts are going to come out differently in different places,” she said. This “is a long-game strategy of forcing the court to take up these issues.”
Some experts said whether it’s part of a legal strategy or simply how the legal battle is unfolding on its own, the states and lawsuits involved will put the issue on the Supreme Court’s radar.

If “the New York courts say one thing and the California courts say another thing, then it’s likely that the Supreme Court may want to weigh in to clarify what the scope of PLCAA is,” said Timothy D. Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University.
A lawsuit challenging public nuisance gun laws could reach the Supreme Court in two to four years, said Clark Neily, who served as the co-counsel on the winning side of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), a landmark Supreme Court case that overturned the city’s ban on handguns and expanded the scope of the Second Amendment to include individual rights.
Some gun-control advocates said they will be closely watching Tuesday when the Court hears arguments in a case — Gonzalez v. Google — concerning liability protections for technology companies for any clues on how the justices view the broader issue of liability laws for specific industries.

At issue is whether tech companies should be held legally liable for harmful content their algorithms promote. This suit takes aim at Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from lawsuits over the posts, photos and videos users share on their platforms.
All-star legal lineup
The NSSF has lined up two legal heavyweights with decades of appellate experience in gun rights cases to handle its multistate public nuisance litigation.
The trade association announced in July that it hired Paul Clement and Erin Murphy to manage its appeal to the 2nd Circuit. The pair left Kirkland & Ellis in June over the firm’s decision to stop taking Second Amendment cases after Clement helped secure the victory in last year’s landmark gun rights case — New York State Rifle & Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen — and started their own boutique practice.
Clement is one of the field’s leading Supreme Court litigators, having served as solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration and arguing dozens of cases in private practice. He also has personal and professional ties to some of the justices — he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in 2018. Neil M. Gorsuch called Clement a “dear friend” during his confirmation hearing in 2017.
Former president Donald Trump also named Clement in a list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees during his 2020 presidential campaign.
The NSSF “could hardly do better than having Paul Clement and Erin Murphy as their legal team,” said Blocher. “They have been involved in some of the most prominent gun litigation over the past few years at the Supreme Court and also at the courts of appeal. So, I have to assume that they’re litigating with an eye toward potential Supreme Court review.”
Clement and Murphy did not respond to requests for comment.
The NRA has weakened. But gun rights drive the GOP more than ever.
As the NRA’s stature continues to decline following years of internal division and legal strife, the ascendant NSSF has taken on a more prominent role in lobbying and public policy debates.
But the NRA isn’t sitting the issue out. Former solicitor general Noel Francisco has filed a brief on behalf of the NRA supporting the NSSF’s New York appeal. The Trump-era official is another high-powered lawyer who has argued several times before the Supreme Court and now serves as the head of Jones Day’s Washington office.
Buffalo’s path forward
For now, Buffalo is pressing forward with its suit as its leaders argue that gun restrictions are needed to prevent more shootings and that Gendron’s sentencing cannot be the only repercussion for the slaying that devastated the city.
“I would say that justice was done with a small ‘j’ today. But we still have a big ‘J’ of justice to do,” Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said following the sentencing.

Feeling unwelcome in blue states, gun companies move to red ones
At least 20 manufacturers have shifted operations to states with friendlier attitudes toward firearms

August 29, 2022 at 7:00 a.m. EDT
Smith & Wesson CEO Mark Smith was fed up. He was running the largest firearms manufacturer in America, based in Springfield, Mass., where it had been making weapons since 1860, and yet state lawmakers were considering a bill to ban the manufacture of AR-15-style rifles for the civilian market. The proposed law would cripple Smith’s company. Sixty percent of Smith & Wesson’s revenue came from AR-15-style guns.
So after years of flirting with the idea, Smith announced last September that Smith & Wesson was pulling up stakes and moving its headquarters from Massachusetts to Tennessee.
Deciding to leave was “extremely difficult,” Smith told investors, but “we feel that we have been left with no other alternative.”
At least 20 firearms, ammunition and gun accessory companies — including some of the industry’s biggest names, such as Beretta and Remington Arms — have moved headquarters or shifted production from traditionally Democratic blue states to Republican red ones over the past decade, relocating thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment amid the nation’s sharpening divide over guns. The companies were enticed by tax breaks and the promise of cheaper labor. But the biggest factor often was the push for stricter gun laws in many of the Democratic-leaning states.

“They’re going where they’re wanted,” said John Harris, a Nashville attorney and executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association.
The result is a firearms industry that is increasingly rooted in the South and, to a lesser extent, the West, weakening ties to the Northeast that stretch back to the Revolutionary War. The dramatic shift illustrates the economic fallout from political polarization among the states, where laws and attitudes are increasingly diverging on hot-button cultural issues, including abortion rights. It also reveals a growing frustration among some left-leaning lawmakers with a homegrown industry that they see as unwilling to even discuss gun violence.
“This is where we part ways,” said Massachusetts state Rep. Bud Williams (D), whose district includes Smith & Wesson’s historic headquarters. “And I’ve been a big supporter of Smith & Wesson. But there’s too many mass shootings. I’m not going to be silent.”
The departures have come in waves, often prompted by legislative reactions to high-profile mass shootings — first the 2012 school shooting in Newtown Conn., and then the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some states run by Democrats tightened gun laws. Republican states often moved in the opposite direction, sometimes loosening gun restrictions in the wake of mass shootings, studies show.

New gun laws led Beretta USA to move its manufacturing operations from Maryland for Tennessee in 2014. Mossberg shipped its shotgun production from Connecticut to Texas that same year. That’s also when Magpul Industries, among the country’s largest producers of ammunition magazines, left Colorado for Texas and Wyoming.
In 2019, Stag Arms trumpeted its departure of Connecticut for Wyoming.
The next year, gunmaker Kimber Manufacturing fled New York for Alabama.
Last November, two months after Smith & Wesson’s farewell, the owner of Remington Arms, the nation’s oldest gunmaker, revealed it was moving its headquarters from Ilion, N.Y. to LaGrange, Ga., pledging to invest $100 million and hire 856 people in its new home.
“We are very excited to come to Georgia, a state that not only welcomes business but enthusiastically supports and welcomes companies in the firearms industry,” Ken D’Arcy, CEO of Roundhill Group, which owns RemArms, said in a statement. His company bought the Remington rifle brand and several others from Remington Outdoor in a bankruptcy sale.
Companies made more than $1B selling powerful guns to civilians, report says
Republican lawmakers have encouraged gun companies to move and looked to lure them to their own states, viewing it as an opportunity to add jobs and burnish culture war credentials.

Last year, Oklahoma lawmakers launched a study of ways to attract gunmakers to the Sooner state. At the 2022 Shot Show, the firearms industry’s major annual trade show, governors from six states traveled to Las Vegas to sell their communities to the manufacturers of guns, ammunition and accessories. All of them were Republicans.
“These states are openly attracting the industry. Some of them have been very aggressive,” said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group based — as it has been for decades — in Newtown, Conn.
The pitch isn’t only about being a safe haven for gun rights. State officials also dangle economic incentives.
Georgia offered $28 million in grants and tax breaks to Remington for its new headquarters. Wyoming gave at least $8 million in grants to Magpul for its relocation. And Smith & Wesson got a big break on property taxes, along with a $9 million grant. Smith & Wesson’s move is expected to boost the company’s earnings per share by about 10 cents a share annually, according to financial disclosures.

“Whatever motivation they have about guns, they’re also motivated by dollars,” Harris, of the Tennessee firearms group, said of the gun companies.
Remington, Smith & Wesson, Magpul, Stag Arms and Kimber did not respond to a request for comment. Beretta declined to comment. Tennessee economic development officials also declined to comment.
The firearms industry is not a huge part of the overall U.S. economy, but it carries symbolic weight. Guns sit at the center of some of the country’s fiercest cultural fights, such as the reach of constitutional rights and worries about crime and violence.
CEO of gunmaker Smith & Wesson blames politicians for gun violence
These days, the firearms industry is growing rapidly, shaking off years of tepid sales during President Donald Trump’s term. (Gun sales tend to spike under Democratic presidents, when the potential for new gun laws seems greater.)
Americans bought an estimated 19.9 million firearms last year — the second most ever, right behind 2020′s pandemic-fueled record tally of nearly 23 million, according to Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting. Employment at firearms and ammunition companies jumped 28 percent from 2015 to 2021, totaling nearly 170,000 people nationwide, according to NSSF data.

The NSSF and the National Rifle Association have cheered on the gunmakers’ caravan of moving vans, attributing the trend to “anti-Second Amendment sentiment” and a search for friendlier states. An NRA journal called America’s First Freedom described the shift as, “Moving to Freer America.”

But most gunmakers are not abandoning blue states entirely.
Beretta USA, subsidiary of Italian gunmaker Beretta, moved 160 jobs from Prince George’s County’s Accokeek, Md., to Gallatin, Tenn., after Maryland lawmakers in 2014 banned dozens of assault-style weapons, including some made by Beretta.
“Why expand in a place where the people who built the gun couldn’t buy it?” Jeffrey Reh, general counsel for Beretta, said to The Washington Post while the state was debating the gun ban.
The bill passed, and Beretta moved. Its $45 million gun plant in Tennessee now employs about 300 people. And while Beretta’s production and research and development teams work there, the gunmaker’s executives and administrative staff — about 100 people — stayed in Maryland.

A recent search of online job ads showed Beretta had nine openings in Tennessee and five in Maryland.
A city that makes guns confronts its role in the Parkland mass shooting
Smith & Wesson plans to keep 1,000 jobs in Massachusetts even after it moves 550 positions, plus another 200 jobs from around the country, and its headquarters to Tennessee, which is expected to be completed next year.
But the loss has been a blow to Springfield.
The city of 155,000 people is located in the Connecticut River Valley, a region once so stocked with firearms manufacturers that it was known as Gun Valley. Springfield was its unofficial capital, the place where George Washington decided to locate the nation’s first armory. Gun making has long been woven into the city’s story.
Smith & Wesson was among the city’s top employers. It donated to local charities and helped sponsor the annual holiday lights display.

“It’s a pretty significant impact,” Timothy Sheehan, the city’s chief development officer, said of the gunmaker’s departure.
Despite the shared history, the relationship between the company and the city had grown strained recently.
The headquarters and its factory gates were the frequent staging ground for protests. Students and religious groups have picketed outside several times since the 2018 Parkland shooting, when a gunman used a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 students and staff.
Last year, the father of a teen killed in that shooting designed a highway billboard that overlooked the firearms plant. It carried the message: “I can’t turn 21 and enjoy my first legal beer because a Florida teen was allowed to get his first legal AR-15.”
Smith & Wesson has responding by digging in and balking at the suggestion it shares responsibility for how its guns are used. This summer, Smith, the chief executive, refused to join executives from other weapons makers when they testified before a House Oversight Committee looking into the firearms industry. He then issued a statement blaming politicians for gun-related crimes and accused them of trying to shift culpability.

The company used to be more willing to talk about ways it could help reduce gun violence.
In 2000, a year after the school mass shooting in Columbine, Colo., President Bill Clinton’s White House and Smith & Wesson announced a legal settlement that included the gunmaker agreeing to install child-safe triggers and to ban sales to gun dealers with checkered pasts. Other gunmakers considered joining the deal. But facing intense pressure from the NRA and the gun industry, Smith & Wesson eventually backed away from the deal. Its chief executive resigned.
The deal was scrapped.
Massachusetts went on to pass some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Long before the gunmaker’s move to Tennessee, it was illegal for Smith & Wesson to sell its AR-15-style rifles to civilians in its home state.
Last year’s proposed state bill would’ve gone even further and outlawed the manufacture of those rifles.
Sheehan, the city’s chief development officer, said he understood the difficult position that the company was in.
“I can also understand the point — the social point — that the legislation was driving at,” Sheehan said.
“But, in my mind,” he said, “you also need to weigh that with the economic impact.”
The bill didn’t pass.
But Smith & Wesson is not coming back.
Williams, the Springfield representative, was among the bill’s co-sponsors.
He knew what it could do to a company in his own backyard.
And he’d once been a big supporter of Smith & Wesson. It was the kind of place where a local kid could land a good job right out of high school and stay a lifetime. As a city councilman, he’d helped push for the company to get property tax cuts. He’d encouraged police departments to buy Smith & Wesson weapons.
But Williams increasingly took note of the toll of gun violence. It wasn’t just the mass shootings. There were the many smaller shootings that seemed to barely make the news.
Smith & Wesson refused to talk about any of it, he said.
He’d seen enough. It was too much. It didn’t matter anymore to him that this was a hometown company.
“I just felt that with all these shootings,” Williams said, “at some point it’s time to put lives over profit.”
Smith & Wesson is expected to open its headquarters down South next year.
Its new home is in a Tennessee county that a couple of years ago declared itself a Second Amendment “sanctuary,” where local leaders vowed to fight against gun control.

The gun that divides a nation
The AR-15 thrives in times of tension and tragedy. This is how it came to dominate the marketplace – and loom so large in the American psyche.
It is revered as a modern-day musket.
It is reviled as a tool for mass killers.

The AR-15 wasn’t supposed to be a bestseller.
The rugged, powerful weapon was originally designed as a soldiers’ rifle in the late 1950s. “An outstanding weapon with phenomenal lethality,” an internal Pentagon report raved. It soon became standard issue for U.S. troops in the Vietnam War, where the weapon earned a new name: the M16.
But few gunmakers saw a semiautomatic version of the rifle — with its shrouded barrel, pistol grip and jutting ammunition magazine — as a product for ordinary people. It didn’t seem suited for hunting. It seemed like overkill for home defense. Gun executives doubted many buyers would want to spend their money on one.

About the terminology  
The industry’s biggest trade shows banished the AR-15 to the back. The National Rifle Association and other industry allies were focused on promoting traditional rifles and handguns. Most gun owners also shunned the AR-15, dismissing it as a “black rifle” that broke from the typical wood-stocked long guns that were popular at the time.
“We’d have NRA members walk by our booth and give us the finger,” said Randy Luth, the founder of gunmaker DPMS, one of the earliest companies to market AR-15s.
Today, the AR-15 is the best-selling rifle in the United States, industry figures indicate. About 1 in 20 U.S. adults — or roughly 16 million people — own at least one AR-15, according to polling data from The Washington Post and Ipsos.
Almost every major gunmaker now produces its own version of the weapon. The modern AR-15 dominates the walls and websites of gun dealers.

The AR-15 has gained a polarizing hold on the American imagination. Its unmistakable silhouette is used as a political statement emblazoned on T-shirts and banners and, among a handful of conservative members of Congress, on silver lapel pins. One Republican lawmaker, Rep. Barry Moore of Alabama, introduced a bill in February to declare the AR-15 the “National Gun of America.”
It also has become a stark symbol of the nation’s gun violence epidemic. Ten of the 17 deadliest U.S. mass shootings since 2012 have involved AR-15s.

This transformation — from made-for-combat weapon to mass-market behemoth and cultural flash point — is the product of a sustained and intentional effort that has forged an American icon.
A Washington Post investigation found that the AR-15’s rise to dominance over the past two decades was sparked by a dramatic reversal in strategy by the country’s biggest gun companies to invest in a product that many in the industry saw as anathema to their culture and traditions.
The Post review — based on interviews with 16 current and former industry executives, some of them talking publicly in depth for the first time, along with internal documents and public filings that describe the changes in previously unknown detail — found that the U.S. firearms industry came to embrace the gun’s political and cultural significance as a marketing advantage as it grasped for new revenue.
The shift began after the 2004 expiration of a federal assault weapons ban that had blocked the sales of many semiautomatic rifles. A handful of manufacturers saw a chance to ride a post-9/11 surge in military glorification while also stoking a desire among new gun owners to personalize their weapons with tactical accessories.
“We made it look cool,” Luth said. “The same reason you buy a Corvette.”
Through it all, even after repeated mass killings involving the AR-15 that accounted for some of the nation’s darkest moments, efforts in Congress to resurrect an assault weapons ban repeatedly fizzled.
Calls by Democratic politicians to renew the ban fell short, with some in their own party voting against it at key moments. Almost no Republican would even entertain the idea. President Donald Trump briefly considered pushing for a ban, asking aides at one point why anyone needed an AR-15, but backed away after advisers warned he would anger his base as well as the NRA.
“The protection of the AR-15 has become the number one priority for the gun lobby,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a vocal supporter of stronger gun laws. He added: “It makes it harder to push this issue on the table because the gun lobby does so much messaging around it.”
Free from congressional scrutiny, the AR-15 has become a consumer product like none other — a barometer of fear and a gauge of political identity, its market success driven by the divisions it sows.

While handguns are involved in the bulk of U.S. gun homicides — responsible for 90 percent of the deaths in cases where details are available, compared to less than 5 percent for rifles, the FBI says — AR-15 sales jump the most with each school shooting and contentious presidential campaign.
They soared in the run-up to the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and after the mass killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, and again ahead of the turbulent 2020 presidential election.
Today, the industry estimates that at least 20 million AR-15s are stored and stashed across the country.
More than 13.7 million of those have been manufactured by U.S. gunmakers just since the Newtown massacre in late 2012, with those sales generating roughly $11 billion in revenue, according to a Post analysis of industry estimates through 2020, the most recently available data. In other words, at least two-thirds of these guns have been made in just the past decade.
Supporters of the AR-15 say its popularity reflects its legitimacy as a tool for law-abiding people. “This firearm is lawfully owned by millions of Americans — used in shooting competitions, for recreational purposes, hunting and home protection,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.
Others say this was not the original idea behind the gun.
Eugene Stoner, a World War II veteran who invented the AR-15 in the late 1950s while working at Armalite, a small engineering firm in Hollywood, had no interest in civilians using his invention, said C. Reed Knight, who owns a Florida gunmaking company and considers Stoner his mentor.
“He looked at this thing as only for the military side of the house,” Knight said. Stoner, who died in 1997, thought his invention was past its prime by the mid-1990s, Knight said. He added that Stoner would have been horrified by the idea that “he invented the tool of all this carnage in the schools.”
Harry Falber, a former executive at Smith & Wesson, one of the country’s best-known firearms brands, saw how Stoner’s invention changed the gun industry. The AR-15’s success came at a huge price, he said.
“The firearms industry, in the aggregate, is very small,” Falber told The Post. “And look at the havoc it wreaks.”

Smith & Wesson made its name with handguns, such as Dirty Harry’s “Feeling Lucky?” six-shooter.
The company had never mass-produced a rifle in its storied history stretching to 1852.
That began to change in 2005.
It was a tough time for the firearms industry. Gun sales had been flat for several years, according to federal background check data, the best available proxy for the number of firearms sold. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shows that American gunmakers produced fewer pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns in 2005 than they had five years earlier.
At Smith & Wesson, executives were looking around for new lines of business when, corporate filings show, a company survey detected strong consumer interest in one gun it didn’t make: a tactical rifle.
“The long gun market is a terrific opportunity,” Michael Golden, then the company’s chief executive, told financial analysts in August 2005.
And the power of the Smith & Wesson brand meant “we have got one foot in the door,” he said.
Neither Smith & Wesson nor Golden, who is no longer with the company, responded to multiple requests for comment.
The market for tactical rifles, such as the AR-15, was still largely untapped. None of the big gunmakers made one.

Designed around the Pentagon’s desire for a lightweight weapon to match Soviet rifles such as the AK-47, the AR-15 fired small bullets at very fast speeds. The higher velocity meant the tiny projectiles became unstable when they penetrated a human body, tumbling through flesh to create devastating wounds. But the real innovation was the addition of a small tube to redirect the gas from fired cartridges. This dampened recoil, making it easier to keep steady aim on a target.
The U.S. military started using the rifle during the Vietnam War, with Colt — which had acquired the gun’s patent rights from Armalite — winning the contract to produce the M16. The new gun was met by complaints that it was prone to jamming, even mid-firefight, until Colt revamped the design. Despite its mixed success, the new gun won over military leaders.
Colt held exclusive rights to the semiautomatic, civilian version of the AR-15 until 1977, when the patent expired. Then, other gunmakers could make and sell AR-15s of their own.
Most in the gun industry remained wary. For decades, the AR-15 was regarded as an outsider. Then came the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
As the U.S. military was sent to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, gunmakers looked to play off the conflict-zone images of soldiers in tactical gear holding M16 and M4 carbine rifles. The next best thing for civilians was buying an AR-15.

“There has never been a better accidental advertising campaign in history,” said Doug Painter, a former president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a firearms industry lobbying group.
Smith & Wesson’s first AR-15 was unveiled to the public in February 2006 at the industry’s marquee annual convention, the Shot Show in Las Vegas. It was called the M&P 15.
While the name indicated the gun was for professionals — “M” for military and “P” for police — the company always had its eyes on the consumer market, according to corporate filings and statements from executives. Golden told financial analysts a few months after the M&P 15’s debut that “our intent when we launched the new tactical rifle was to first penetrate the consumer market.”
Many gun company executives saw military and police sales as less profitable, due to lower prices and precise specifications, according to documents and interviews. But they were still important because of the “halo effect,” as a 2009 document prepared for Smith & Wesson called it, in which buyers would be attracted to what they saw professionals using.
The consumer “does pay attention to that,” a Smith & Wesson executive at the time, James Debney, would later explain to financial analysts in 2016.

The M&P 15 was a hit. Smith & Wesson reported revenue from this line of tactical rifles more than quintupled in the gun’s first five full years on the market — from $12.8 million to $75.1 million.
Other big gunmakers soon followed Smith & Wesson’s lead.
New Hampshire-based Sig Arms, later renamed Sig Sauer, said in late 2006 that it planned to make an AR-15 — soon after the firm had been “about two seconds away from imploding,” chief executive Ron Cohen later told Management Today.
The new rifle was credited with helping save the company. Sig Sauer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Wall Street noticed the sales blitz, too.
A private equity firm called Cerberus Capital Management had rolled up several gunmakers into a single conglomerate called Freedom Group. In late 2007, it purchased AR-15 maker DPMS, which was bringing in nearly $100 million in annual sales, said Luth, its founder.
“They saw the AR-15 as the cash cow, which it was,” Luth said.
The change in attitudes toward the AR-15 occurred with “mind-boggling” speed, recalled Ryan Busse, who wrote about his turn from gun industry executive to critic in his 2021 book “Gunfight.”
The AR-15 was suddenly being celebrated after years of being widely viewed with suspicion, Busse said. Gunmakers were no longer avoiding the gun that many had once regarded as the kind of weapon that society would disdain.
He recalled the pressure within the industry to either get on board with the AR-15 or keep quiet. In 2007, prominent hunting writer and TV host Jim Zumbo lost his industry jobs after calling for a ban on hunting with AR-15s. His fate became a watchword: Cross the AR-15 and you might get Zumboed. Zumbo did not respond to requests for comment.
“Nobody thought AR-15s were a good idea just a couple years ago,” Busse said. “And then you couldn’t criticize them without getting fired.”
A marketplace and rebrand for the AR-15

In 2008, economic crisis and political upheaval bolstered the AR-15’s market appeal, according to several industry insiders, as the stock market collapsed under the weight of soured mortgage securities and the country elected its first Black president, a Democrat portrayed by conservatives as an anti-gun radical.
Obama’s victory created an opening for pro-gun groups to tease the potential for a new assault weapons ban — a claim that industry executives have credited with energizing AR-15 sales.
In 2008, when growing demand led U.S. gunmakers to increase production of all firearms by 15 percent, AR-15 production rose by 65 percent, according to government and industry figures. These AR-15s were rapidly becoming a larger share of the overall firearms market — reaching 10 percent of all guns made that year for the first time.
Jeff Buchanan, then-chief financial officer at Smith & Wesson, recalled several years later at a business conference that Obama spurred sales “because he was a pronounced liberal” and “people buy because they are afraid of future legislation.”
Obama was mockingly crowned 2009’s “gun salesman of the year” by the gun-friendly news service Outdoor Wire.

That same year, in what many industry insiders saw as a watershed moment, another legendary American gunmaker, Ruger, entered the AR-15 market with its SR-556. The Southport, Conn.-based company had a reputation for high-end firearms. Its corporate motto was “Arms Makers for Responsible Citizens.”
Michael Fifer, the gunmaker’s CEO at the time, described to financial analysts in 2009 how Ruger brought in roughly $200 from each handgun — but each AR-15-style rifle brought in $1,000.
“That’s kind of a 5-to-1 ratio there,” Fifer said.
Ruger declined to comment through its general counsel.
AR-15 fans saw Ruger’s new rifle as validation of a once-taboo gun.
“There is no better illustration for this change than the Evil Black Rifle itself which has just joined the Ruger product offering,” Steve Johnson wrote on his popular Firearm Blog, using a sarcastic name popular with gun owners for AR-15s.
Getting comfortable with the AR-15, industry allies worked to soften the image of the “black rifle.”
NSSF executives recalled in interviews with The Post that they bemoaned that the public mistakenly thought the “AR” stood for “assault rifle.”
“We should not cede the rhetorical high ground to our political enemies,” Larry Keane, the NSSF’s general counsel, recalled saying during a 2009 meeting.
They brainstormed ways to rebrand the gun and win over traditional hunters.
“I just said, ‘It’s a modern sporting rifle,’” recalled Painter, then the NSSF president. “And there the phrase stuck.”
The NSSF just needed to persuade others to use the term, which it shortened to “MSR.”
Glenn Sapir, then the NSSF’s director of editorial services, recalled that executives pressed gunmakers and industry publications to adopt the name. It slowly began popping up in gun magazines and catalogues. Companies used it during earnings calls. Gun owners were given pocket fact cards with the preferred talking points.

How the AR-15 became America’s gun
At a school in Nashville on Monday, a shooter used two AR-style weapons and a handgun to kill three children and three adults. Today on “Post Reports,” we look at the history of the AR-15 and how it became America’s gun.
A four-page ad from the NSSF’s foundation spelled out the campaign.
“Some hunters look askance at AR-style rifles, and that’s understandable,” read the ad in the November 2009 issue of Outdoor Life magazine. “They don’t look like any type of rifle they, their dads or granddads ever carried into the woods. Looks can be deceiving, however, and in the case of AR-platform rifles, they certainly are.”
Some AR-15 supporters saw the MSR campaign as a phony attempt to make the black rifle seem less ominous — even though what many loved most about it was the threatening look.
“The true AR enthusiasts, they kind of saw through it,” Luth said. “It stuck, but not with the true believers.”
How gunmakers craft ‘realistic’ gaming experiences

Video games introduced a new generation to the AR-15 through popular first-person shooter games such as “Call of Duty.” Players got to simulate using military weapons with down-to-the-bolt realism.
The firearms industry was eager to help out.
In 2010, representatives of two gun manufacturers and a video game maker converged at an outdoor shooting range north of Las Vegas. Employees from two Freedom Group subsidiaries deployed a stockpile of weapons, including AR-15s, while technicians from Infinity Ward, developer of “Call of Duty,” carefully recorded the sounds, according to participants. Infinity Ward’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, declined to comment.
No detail, even the click of inserting a magazine, was too small to capture, participants said.
“We went through all the guns slowly and methodically, shooting until they got the quality sound they needed,” recalled Cory Weisnicht, who was an employee with a Freedom Group company tasked with firing the guns at the Clark County Shooting Complex.
The meeting reflected a move by some gunmakers at the time to strike licensing agreements with gaming firms to feature certain firearms, according to lawyers and experts, along with interviews and documents obtained by The Post.
“We wanted the brand exposure,” said a former employee of a Freedom Group subsidiary familiar with the Las Vegas meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company strategy.
The push for realism in shooting video games was influential for some buyers, retailers said. Many gun owners bought real-world versions of the firearms they used online, said Lucas Botkin, founder of the gun gear outfitter T.Rex Arms. And they could accessorize their guns in the same way.
Botkin recalled how he fixed up his first AR-15.
“I built it out very similarly to what I had in ‘Modern Warfare,’” he said, referring to the M4 in a game in the Call of Duty series. “It was my reference point.”

The AR-15 also was winning over new fans in other ways.
In the Philadelphia suburbs, Bill Shanley saw his first AR-15 up close when one of his adult sons came home with one in 2010. Shanley was in his mid-50s and had been raised around guns. He’d taught his own children how to shoot, too. But he’d never given much thought to the AR-15.
“It never would’ve occurred to me to get a gun like that,” Shanley recalled.
Father and son took the AR-15 to a gun range. Shanley couldn’t believe how loud it was, even with ear protection, the sound crashing off the range overhang. But the black rifle had little recoil. It was fun to shoot. Three shots with his old hunting rifle bruised his shoulder. Fifty rounds with the AR-15 felt like a breeze. Shanley was sold. He soon bought his own, a Smith & Wesson M&P 15.

The AR-15 changed Shanley’s thinking about these kinds of weapons. Now, he saw them as no different from the traditional firearms owned by his great-grandfather or the shotgun his uncle gave him when he was a teenager. His dad used to keep a shotgun at home for protection. Shanley, a manufacturing sales manager, started keeping an AR-15 in his bedroom.
“The AR is the modern-day musket,” he said.
An uneasiness over AR-15 marketing

Harry Falber knew little about the gun world when he joined Smith & Wesson, first as a consultant and then as head of licensing at the gunmaker’s headquarters in Springfield, Mass.
But he knew how to sell big consumer brands after years of working on ads at Volvo, Polaroid and Hallmark.
“A consumer wants to be identified with the product they are using, and a gun is no different,” said Falber, speaking publicly in detail about his tenure at Smith & Wesson for the first time.
Falber thought Smith & Wesson’s line of M&P firearms was “a brilliant marketing name.” And he loved Smith & Wesson’s strong reputation and long history.
But he said he struggled with how to sell a military weapon to civilians.
“I didn’t care what you did with it,” he said. “It was still a black gun.”
In late 2010, after he had been with the company for about a year, Falber commissioned a study comparing two Smith & Wesson ads that had recently appeared in Guns & Ammo magazine, according to internal documents obtained by The Post.
One showed Falber’s vision for selling guns. It featured a silver revolver and a black pistol, side by side against the light backdrop of a range target, under the block type “FINE-TUNED MACHINES.”
The other ad showed what looked like a police SWAT team officer, with dark gloves and tactical helmet, pointing an AR-15 at some unseen target in the distance. “THE CHOSEN ONE,” it read.
Consumers gave higher scores to the “FINE-TUNED MACHINES” ad, according to the report, which recommended that future ads be tested “to maximize message, positive image, and consumer motivation.”
Falber thought he had won the argument. He wanted to stress craftsmanship.
But Smith & Wesson went in the direction of “THE CHOSEN ONE.”
“They went full-bore into a dark, dark milieu,” Falber said.

Smith & Wesson was not alone in adopting messages that made Falber uneasy.
Bushmaster was running ads for its AR-15 with the line “CONSIDER YOUR MAN CARD REISSUED.” Daniel Defense posted social media ads showing its AR-15 with a helmeted soldier in a war zone under “USE WHAT THEY USE.”
“It was just appealing to the worst levels of what you can conjure up in someone’s mind,” Falber said. “And we’d been nurturing this.”
Daniel Defense declined to comment.
By 2011, the AR-15 and similar firearms enjoyed warm welcomes at the gun industry’s biggest events. They were the stars. Half the exhibition space at the annual Shot Show was now occupied by AR-15 gunmakers and tactical-equipment makers — even as the convention itself had doubled in size to 500,000 square feet, said Painter, the former NSSF president.
Every exhibitor clamored to be next to the big rifles because that’s where the crowds were.
“The best analogy is the AR rifle was like the kids who wore their baseball hats turned around,” Painter said. “It wasn’t cool until suddenly it became cool.”

But Falber wanted out.
“I just couldn’t stomach driving up there anymore,” he said.
In 2012, he quit Smith & Wesson.
The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary came two months later.
A little after 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2012, a man used a Bushmaster AR-15 to shoot his way into the school in Newtown. The gunman fired 154 rounds in minutes, striking children who were just 6 and 7 years old multiple times, according to a Connecticut state’s attorney’s report. Twenty children and six school employees were killed.
Falber lived 20 miles from Newtown. His wife worked in education. He could imagine the scene inside. He was in disbelief. He took no comfort in the fact that the rifle used in the massacre was made by Bushmaster and not Smith & Wesson.
“It ripped me apart,” he said.
Mass killings, politics fuel division on AR-15

The deadliest mass killing at a K-12 school in U.S. history focused attention like never before on the destructive power of the AR-15.
With Newtown, the weapon so meticulously marketed as a “sporting rifle” had been used as a killing machine that destroyed the bodies of young victims.
Cerberus, the private equity giant, soon announced plans to sell off Freedom Group — the conglomerate it had assembled as a big bet on the AR-15’s success and the owner of the Bushmaster brand. Cerberus declined to comment. One of its companies at the time owned Bushmaster, maker of the weapon used in the shooting, which would eventually defend its firearms advertising as lawful in a lawsuit filed by Newtown families alleging the gunmaker’s marketing was aimed at troubled young men.
Dick’s Sporting Goods immediately stopped selling AR-15s at its flagship stores during what the company called “this time of national mourning.”
Collaboration between gunmakers and the gaming industry also came to a quick end, said Glen Schofield, co-director of “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.”
“We all kind of want to leave that era behind us,” he said. “Every time there was a mass shooting we got blamed.”
Days after the shooting, Obama called for new gun laws, citing public support for banning “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. But any notion that the tragedy in Newtown would compel the politically influential NRA to compromise evaporated a week later. Wayne LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, unveiled a school security plan that boiled down to his mantra of “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

NRA leaders feared there would be momentum for a ban, and they even huddled with companies and lobbyists to begin plotting strategy, former officials said.
But the focus on banning the AR-15 only made the gun more popular with firearms enthusiasts, NRA leaders later said.
“People who never planned to buy one went out and got one,” said Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist who was on the NRA board. “It was an f-you to the left.”
David Keene, who was the NRA’s president at the time, said that was the moment gun rights became a top issue for Republicans — with the AR-15 at the center.
“It became a political symbol,” said Keene, who also served as the longtime chairman of the American Conservative Union.
The NRA’s embrace of the AR-15 was also practical, said Joshua Powell, a former longtime NRA adviser and chief of staff to LaPierre. NRA membership numbers were declining, but AR-15 owners remained loyal. Powell said the organization wanted the rifle to be viewed as “America’s gun.”
“The heart and soul of the NRA membership was hardcore AR folks,” Powell said.
The move to defend the AR-15 was off-putting to some NRA members, such as John Goodwin, who worked as an NRA lobbyist in the late 2000s and now belongs to a gun safety advocacy group called 97Percent. Discussions about the AR-15 sounded nothing like how he talked about the shotgun he used for bird hunting.
“They make it sound like the AR-15 is a religious relic,” Goodwin said.
The AR-15’s resilience post-Newtown was clear weeks later when the organizer of a major gun event in Harrisburg, Pa., the Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show, was forced to cancel amid the backlash from its decision to ban displays of the weapon.
“We’re not going to go into business with people saying you can’t have this gun or that gun,” Tommy Millner, CEO of the outdoor retailing giant Cabela’s at the time, recalled saying when he pulled the company’s sponsorship.
Any push for a new assault weapons ban seemed destined to fail in Congress. And gun sales were soaring again.
In December 2012, the same month as the Newtown shooting, monthly gun background checks hit what at the time was an all-time high of 2.8 million and stayed elevated for months.
Stores were picked clean of their AR-15 inventory. Prices jumped.
While the government doesn’t break out AR-15 sales, the industry group NSSF estimated that companies produced at least 3.2 million AR-15s firearms in 2012 and 2013 alone — more than they’d made in the entire previous decade.
When a new assault weapons ban finally came to a vote in the Democratic-led Senate soon after Newtown, it didn’t come close to passing — earning just 40 votes.
Just one Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, voted in favor. But even more galling to gun-control advocates was that just 38 of the chamber’s 54 Democrats voted in favor.
After Congress failed to act, a handful of states, such as Connecticut, New York and Maryland, moved to pass their own assault weapons bans.

In March 2013, C.J. Grisham, then an Army master sergeant, decided to sling an AR-15 over his shoulder and take a walk with his son along a dirt road in tiny Temple, Tex. He wasn’t breaking the law, but a police officer stopped him.
“Some reason why you have this?” the officer asked, grabbing the rifle.
“’Cause I can,” Grisham said.
The officer drew his pistol and pinned Grisham to the hood.
The encounter ended peacefully, but it was caught on video and posted online. Almost overnight, Grisham, who was later convicted of misdemeanor police interference, became the face of a movement.
“It wasn’t that I was carrying a rifle,” recalled Grisham, a former member of the Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violence. “It was the fact I was carrying that rifle.”
Grisham went on to create Open Carry Texas, a group advocating for carrying weapons in public. Open-carry demonstrations had been cropping up in conservative states since the 2008 election, typically with holstered pistols, but Grisham’s group pushed a new tactic. Its members made a show of carrying hunting rifles, shotguns and AR-15s as they visited places like Sonic, Chipotle and Home Depot.

Even the NRA was uneasy about the brash, public displays. It called the Texas protests “downright weird.” But so many gun owners sided with Grisham that the NRA quickly flip-flopped, saying its original opposition had been a mistake.
It became increasingly common to see people openly armed with black rifles at protests and political rallies — their AR-15s gripped in their hands or slung over their shoulders. The practice would take off on the far right, as armed demonstrators would play a prominent role in white-supremacist gatherings such as the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, as well as protests in 2020 against pandemic restrictions and counterdemonstrations against racial justice activists.
The AR-15 seemed to be everywhere. Its cultural profile was rising, not unlike the way the Soviet-made Kalashnikov became a symbol of insurgency and freedom for many around the world.
Companies such as Black Rifle Coffee Co. launched. Youth baseball teams ran AR-15 raffles as fundraisers. Companies offered free AR-15s with a new roof or new car, like banks giving away toasters for new checking accounts.
More political candidates were displaying AR-15s in campaign ads, too — and not just conservatives looking to impress their base. Jason Kander, an Army veteran and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, put out a 2016 campaign ad that showed him assembling an AR-15 while blindfolded. Kander did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2016, amid rising political tensions with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump vying for the White House, the U.S. gun industry reported that it had crossed an important threshold: It produced more than 2 million AR-15s for the first time, 63 percent more than were manufactured the year before, according to NSSF estimates.
The AR-15 had truly entered the mainstream.
America’s angst with the AR-15

Manny Oliver tended to view guns like an outsider.
Ever since moving to Florida from his native Venezuela years ago, Oliver had noticed how people in his new home tied guns to notions of freedom and patriotism.
“In America, they treat guns like they are their salvation,” Oliver said.
He didn’t understand it. But like many people, he didn’t feel the need to.
By 2018, he and his wife, Patricia, had settled near Parkland, Fla., an affluent suburb outside Fort Lauderdale. Gun violence rarely intruded, except when mass shootings made the news. Oliver recalled talking with his teenage son, Joaquin, about the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, where a gunman with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people. And Joaquin had been rattled by the 2017 Las Vegas shooting — where a gunman used an arsenal that included AR-15s to kill 60 people — because his mom had been there on a business trip just a week earlier.
It seemed so random, Oliver said.
Four months later, on Valentine’s Day 2018, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland armed with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 and killed 17 people. Joaquin, 17, died after being shot multiple times, according to testimony at the gunman’s trial.
The shooting ignited a new kind of anti-gun activism that was intensely personal, such as the student-led March for Our Lives that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters to the National Mall a month later. They were grieving. And they were angry.

“I refused to think this is a normal thing that happens,” Oliver said.
He and his wife founded a gun violence prevention group called Change the Ref and focused on attention-grabbing projects such as renting a billboard outside Smith & Wesson’s headquarters in Massachusetts with a picture of their son.
The Parkland shooting also highlighted America’s growing unease with the AR-15.
Kroger raised the minimum age to buy guns and ammunition from 18 to 21. Walmart — which had quietly stopped selling AR-15s three years earlier, in 2015 — did the same.
Top NRA officials worked to persuade other retailers, such as Bass Pro Shops, not to pull AR-15s from their shelves, according to Powell, the group’s former chief of staff.
“The gun folks will go nuts against you, and it’s going to be incredibly bad for business, and it’s going to get you a lot of bad press,” Powell recalled NRA officials telling Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris. In other cases, Powell warned there would be NRA member boycotts.
Morris backed down, Powell said. “He understood who his customers were.”
A representative for Bass Pro Shops said Morris had no “recollection” of the conversation. “Decisions on the products and services we offer have always been based on customer preferences in compliance with all federal, state and local laws,” the spokesman said.
Unable to just move on, the shooting forced Oliver and his wife to reinvent their lives.
“We are not searching for happiness,” he said. “I don’t think we’re ever going to be happy.”
An uptick in shootings and a stalemate on gun control

Shortly after Parkland, President Donald Trump repeatedly floated the idea of supporting a new assault weapons ban.
He mentioned it on live television to one of the Senate’s most vocal gun-control backers, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and in a private meeting with Parkland families. His comments rattled NRA officials and some of his own advisers.
NRA representatives later warned Trump against taking action. “They came up here and said to him, the base is going to blow you up,” according to a former official who sat in during a series of meetings with the NRA. They, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions.
But Trump kept coming back to the idea, according to several former administration officials.
In the summer of 2019, after back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso involving an AR-15-style pistol and an AKM-style rifle, Trump told aides that he wanted to ban AR-15s, according to people present for the statements.
“I don’t know why anyone needs an AR-15,” Trump told aides as he flew on Marine One to the White House in August 2019, according to a person who heard his comments.
As one former official put it in describing the real estate developer turned politician, “His reflexes were a New York liberal on guns. He doesn’t have knee-jerk conservative reflexes.”
But Trump was also petrified of the NRA and others taking him on, former advisers said, and heard from a number of advisers that it would be unpopular. Trump ultimately stopped entertaining the idea of working with Democrats on gun control later that year, when he was caught in a scandal over his now-infamous phone call with Ukraine’s president.
“F--- it, I’m not going to work with them on anything. They’re f---ing impeaching me,” Trump said in one Oval Office meeting, according to a participant.
Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesman, did not respond to detailed findings in this article but said that “there had been no bigger defender of the Second Amendment than President Trump.” He said that Trump had offered other proposals after mass shootings, such as adding security guards to schools and allowing teachers who are licensed to carry a weapon to do so.
Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut and a participant in a White House meeting on a potential ban, described Trump’s lack of action as a missed opportunity for an unusually powerful Republican leader. “I said this to Trump in that meeting: I think the Republican Party would have followed him wherever he went, and he ultimately decided to stand with the NRA,” Murphy said.
But, Murphy said, the burst of post-Parkland activism transformed gun politics among Democrats. Many in the party, he said, started to see gun control as a cause that could energize their core voters — rather than fearing it as one that would rile up the right.
“For whatever reason those kids finally shamed the Democratic Party into running on this issue,” Murphy said.
Several months after the Parkland shooting, one of the Democrats who had voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013 in the wake of Newtown announced he had changed his mind.
Sen. Mark R. Warner, who earned the NRA’s support as Virginia’s governor in the mid-2000s, represented a state that was now trending more liberal. He would go on to co-sponsor new proposed assault weapons bans in the Senate.
“While I was far from the deciding vote,” Warner wrote of the post-Newtown legislation in a 2018 op-ed in The Post, “I have nevertheless wrestled with that ‘no’ vote ever since.” Despite his own role in helping to defeat the ban, Warner described Congress’s failure to act as part of a “sad pattern of dysfunction.”
The AR-15, however, was about to reach new heights of popularity.

In 2020, a year of pandemic lockdowns, racial justice protests and a bitterly fought presidential campaign, U.S. gunmakers produced about 2.5 million AR-15s, according to the NSSF. That added up to roughly 1 in 4 of all guns that ATF said were manufactured in the United States.
Helped by its line of M&P 15 rifles, Smith & Wesson saw its sales nearly double to a record $1.1 billion, according to financial filings. CEO Mark Smith described it as “the most successful year in the 169-year history of the company.”
One Smith & Wesson M&P 15 sold in 2020 ended up in the hands of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two people and wounded a third during that summer’s racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wis.
Rittenhouse, later found not guilty based on claims of self-defense, explained during his trial why he chose an AR-15: “I thought it looked cool.” Rittenhouse could not be reached for comment.
The AR-15 was also especially alluring to the gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo in May 2022.
“The AR-15 and its variants are very deadly when used properly,” he wrote in a manifesto filled with hateful vitriol. “Which is the reason I picked one.”
Ten days later, 19 schoolchildren and two adults were shot to death in Uvalde, Tex., with another AR-15, the Daniel Defense DDM4.
The string of attacks prompted President Biden, who as a senator had strongly supported the 1994 assault weapons ban, to promise a renewed effort to stop the sale of military-style weapons.
“For God’s sake, how much more carnage are we willing to accept?” Biden said in June.
Then, a gunman with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 killed seven people at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Ill.
Later that month, executives from five gunmakers were called to Capitol Hill to answer questions about AR-15s. The hearing played out in expected fashion. Democrats decried the gunmakers, the Republicans defended them, and the gun executives deflected.
“A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil,” said Christopher Killoy, chief executive at Ruger.
Smith & Wesson’s chief executive refused to show up.
A House Oversight report produced for the hearing spotlighted the money earned by the gun industry, saying that Ruger’s gross earnings from AR-15 rifles nearly tripled from 2019 to 2021 to more than $103 million.
Two days later, the Democratic-led House passed a new assault weapons ban on a tight party-line vote of 217-213 — the first time the measure had been voted on in nearly three decades. But the Senate, also run by Democrats, never took action.
Amid the growing scrutiny, Smith & Wesson chief executive Mark Smith put out a statement claiming his company’s guns were not responsible for any crimes, but politicians and the media “are the ones to blame for the surge in violence and lawlessness.”
Smith’s comment was a revealing reminder of just how much the firearms industry had changed — from defender of a gun culture familiar to many Americans to a mass producer and leading champion of AR-15s.
That new legacy permeated this year’s Shot Show, held in January in Las Vegas.
At the same event two decades ago, AR-15s were shown only in restricted areas in the back.
This year, Smith & Wesson’s sprawling exhibit was surrounded by other gunmakers offering their own AR-15s, such as Mossberg, Black Rain Ordnance and Savage Arms. Smith & Wesson promoted its latest addition to its AR-15 lineup: the M&P Volunteer.
The closed-door trade event was open only to people with industry ties. But photographs and video reviewed by The Post showed racks of matte black Volunteer rifles in different configurations, such as the M&P 15 Volunteer XV Pro, with a suggested retail price of $1,569.
Back home in Connecticut, Falber, the former marketing executive, still admired the “M&P” name. But “Volunteer” felt different to him. He shrugged off the suggestion that it was just a nod to Smith & Wesson’s decision to begin moving its headquarters from liberal Massachusetts to conservative Tennessee, whose nickname is the Volunteer State.
Putting that name on such a powerful rifle evoked scenes of armed civilian patrols along the country’s southern border and at racial justice protests, Falber said.
Maybe, he said, it will help Smith & Wesson sell the AR-15. “But,” he added, “how many more guns can they possibly sell?”

Highland Park victims try Sandy Hook legal strategy: Sue the gunmaker

Survivors and families of those killed and wounded in a shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill., are suing the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack and two gun stores that they say helped the gunman carry out the massacre.
The suit against Smith & Wesson follows a similar one by families of victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which ended with Remington Arms, the maker of the AR-15-style rifle used in the killings, agreeing to pay $73 million in February.
The group of survivors is also suing Robert E. Crimo III, the man charged in connection with the shooting in a Chicago suburb, which killed seven and injured more than 40, according to court records filed Tuesday in Lake County Circuit Court. Crimo faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Also named in the lawsuit are his father Robert Crimo Jr. who allegedly helped his son legally obtain the assault rifle used in the rampage, along with gun stores Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms.
Attorneys representing the families filed a set of 10 civil complaints alleging negligence, aiding and abetting, battery and assault following a shooting they say was “foreseeable” and “entirely preventable.”
“The community in and around Highland Park has been devastated by this tragic shooting and too many lives have been lost or forever changed,” Antonio M. Romanucci, one of the lawyers representing survivors, said in a news release. “Parents and grandparents lost their lives while simply trying to spend time with their families, others were shot and seriously wounded, including one young boy who has paid the highest price and will never ride his bike or run again.”

A representative with Smith & Wesson did not immediately respond to a message from The Washington Post. Bud’s Gun Shop, an online gun distributor, also did not respond to a message when reached by The Post. A man who answered the phone of Illinois gun shop Red Dot Arms and who declined to identify himself when reached by The Post said the store “had no comment.”
A public defender representing Crimo, who has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail, could not be immediately reached by The Post. George Gomez, an attorney for his father, declined to comment when reached by The Post.
As Highland Park heads back to school, scars of July 4th shooting remain
The attorneys representing the families of three of those killed in the Highland Park shooting and dozens of injured allege the “shooter was the type of a young consumer susceptible to Smith & Wesson’s deceptive and unfair marketing, and was enabled by his father.” The lawsuits also allege that both gun stores, Bud’s Gun Shop and Red Dot Arms, negligently and illegally sold the weapon used during the attack, an M&P15 assault rifle.

“The use of a Smith & Wesson M&P15 for this nefarious purpose was predictable and preventable and there must be accountability for the corporate decisions that incubated this tragedy, clearly dismissing public safety while bringing in record earnings. With this litigation we intend to end the Smith & Wesson manipulation of consumers,” Romanucci said in the news release.
According to the complaints, Smith & Wesson deceptively markets its M&P rifles line as if it were approved and/or used by the U.S. military, an unfair practice “particularly effective with young men fascinated with militaristic combat missions.”
The lawsuits also claim Bud’s Gun Shop sold the assault rifle to the gunman although it is illegal for Highwood and Highland Park residents to buy and possess assault weapons. Bud’s Gun Shop later shipped the rifle to Red Dot Arms, the gun dealer in Illinois, which the lawsuit alleges illegally gave the shooter access to the weapon. According to the complaints, both stores knew that they were selling an assault rifle to a resident of a municipality where possession is not allowed by law because they were aware of his address, but still went forward with the sales.

Synagogue shooting victims can sue gunmaker Smith & Wesson, California judge rules

The survivors and families of victims of a shooting at a California synagogue in 2019 may proceed with a lawsuit filed against the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack, as well as the gun store that sold it, after a ruling issued by a San Diego judge last week.
San Diego County Superior Court Judge Kenneth J. Medel dismissed manufacturer Smith & Wesson’s assertion that the lawsuit was barred under a law that protects gunmakers from some liability when their products are used for crimes. In a ruling released Wednesday, Medel said the lawsuit demonstrated sufficient negligence on the part of Smith & Wesson in marketing the gun, an assault-style semiautomatic rifle that can be modified to fire automatically.
On April 27, 2019, the last day of Passover, John Earnest allegedly opened fire on members of the Chabad of Poway synagogue. The shooting left Poway resident Lori Kaye, 60, dead, and three injured, including a rabbi and an 8-year-old. Earnest, described in the ruling as “bent on waging war on the worshippers and exterminating the Jewish people,” used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle during the attack, police said.

Earnest faces state and federal prosecution on charges of murder and hate crimes, and for alleged civil rights violations.
The lawsuit says Smith & Wesson designed the M&P 15, similar to the popular AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, so it could be easily modified to fire automatically. The lawsuit also says the company used marketing on social media and in advertising, “through videogame-like commercials despite the known risks that young people in that demographic are highly susceptible to that type of advertising and have disproportionately perpetrated mass shooting using similar firearms.”
In addition to naming Smith & Wesson, the ruling says San Diego Guns, the store where Earnest purchased the rifle, can now be sued by the plaintiffs. Earnest was 19 at the time of the shooting and did not have a hunting license exempting him from California’s minimum age of 21 for owning long guns such as the M&P 15.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), signed into law in 2005, shields gunmakers from litigation when the weapons they produce are used in criminal acts. It does not, however, apply in cases of negligence or deliberate violations of state laws.

Last week’s ruling is the latest instance of gunmakers facing potential liability when their products are used in large-scale violence. In 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the manufacturer of the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle used in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School could be sued by the families of the victims. Twenty-six people died in that attack, including 20 children.
The Las Vegas shooter modified a dozen rifles to shoot like automatic weapons
In April, 2020, a federal judge in Nevada ruled that the manufacturers of the weapons used in the 2017 Route 91 Harvest Musical Festival shooting in Las Vegas would have to face a wrongful-death claim brought by one of the 58 people who died. In that ruling, U.S. District Judge Andrew P. Gordon wrote that the family of Carrie Parsons had shown that “the defendant’s AR-15s could be easily modified with bump stocks to shoot automatically, which the shooter did with tragic results. So the [Parsonses] have sufficiently alleged causation.” Gordon ruled that the PLCAA did not bar the wrongful-death claim and referred the case to the Nevada Supreme Court.

Jonathan Lowy, chief counsel for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said on the Brady Campaign website: “Today’s judgment is a victory, and an important step on the road to justice for the victims of the shooting at Chabad of Poway Synagogue, and all Americans who believe that the gun industry is not above the law. We look forward to proving our case in court, and working to prevent future tragedies.”

Companies made more than $1B selling powerful guns to civilians, report says
House oversight committee accused gun manufacturers of “manipulative marketing campaigns” and profiting off violence.

July 27, 2022 at 7:19 p.m. EDT
Five gun companies made more than $1 billion over the last decade selling powerful “military-style assault weapons to civilians,” with their revenue surging amid an increase in firearm violence nationwide, a House committee reported on Wednesday.
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform assailed the gun companies, saying they deployed “manipulative marketing campaigns” that sought to connect masculinity with purchasing rifles. Some of the gun manufacturers have seen revenue more than double or triple in recent years, the committee said.
“The gun industry has flooded our neighborhoods, our schools and even our churches and synagogues with these deadly weapons, and has gotten rich doing it,” House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) said during a hearing on the issue Wednesday.
The staggering scope of U.S. gun deaths goes far beyond mass shootings
The committee, which said it had studied manufacturers that sold AR-15-style weapons used in mass killings, released its findings after a string of such shootings, including this year in Highland Park, Ill.; Uvalde, Tex.; and Buffalo. Mass killings account for a small share of overall gun violence in the United States; both have increased in recent years.

Appearing before the committee on Capitol Hill, chief executives from two of the companies defended their products as well as ownership of such powerful rifles. The core issue, they said, was not the guns themselves, but the people who might use them to inflict mass carnage.

“Mass shootings were all but unheard of just a few decades ago,” said Marty Daniel, chief executive of Daniel Defense, the gunmaker that produced the weapons used in the Uvalde elementary school massacre, which killed 19 children and two teachers, and a deadly attack in Las Vegas in 2017 that killed 60 people. “So what changed? Not the firearms.”
“I believe our nation’s response needs to focus not on the type of gun, but on the type of persons who are likely to commit mass shootings,” Daniel said. He called the massacres in Uvalde, Buffalo and Highland Park “pure evil” and “unfathomable.”
Gunmaker’s Super Bowl stunt sheds light on marketing of ‘America’s rifle’
The other companies named in the report were Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, and Sturm, Ruger & Co. Christopher Killoy, president and chief executive of Ruger, also appeared at the hearing Wednesday, and he acknowledged “tension between our constitutional right to own firearms and the harm inflicted by criminals who acquire them.”

But, he said, the latter should not prevent people from exercising the former.
“We firmly believe that it is wrong to deprive citizens of their constitutional right to purchase the lawful firearm they desire because of the criminal acts of wicked people,” Killoy said. “A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil. The difference is in the intent of the individual possessing it, which we respectfully submit should be the focus of any investigation into the root causes of criminal violence involving firearms.”
Deadly gun violence has surged across the country, with fatal shootings nationwide spiking in 2020 and 2021 to the highest levels in a quarter-century. At the same time, Americans have bought a flood of new guns, with more than 43 million firearms purchased over those years, according to a Washington Post analysis.
Chicago homicides over July 4 weekend eclipsed the grim toll in Highland Park
Even as the testimony was unfolding in Washington, communities across the country were still confronting the aftermath of recent mass shootings. The gunman accused of opening fire in Highland Park earlier this month, killing seven people during an Independence Day parade, was indicted Wednesday on 117 counts by a grand jury, including charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and aggravated battery.
Advertisement
And in South Florida, a jury continued to hear testimony in a trial meant to determine whether a gunman who killed 17 people in a Parkland, Fla., high school in 2018 should be sentenced to death.
The House committee launched its investigation into gun manufacturers in May, following the back-to-back killings in Uvalde and Buffalo, which galvanized enough public response to fuel the passage of modest gun-control legislation for the first time in decades.
How the Senate's gun deal came together after a 30-year logjam
Maloney pointed to the committee’s findings in criticizing the gun companies for how they promoted guns, which she said “includes marketing to children, preying on young men’s insecurities and even appealing to violent white supremacists.”
Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the committee’s ranking Republican, spoke skeptically of laws that limit firearms ownership and pushed back on criticism of the gun companies.
Advertisement
“Gun manufacturers do not cause violent crime,” he said. “Criminals cause violent crime.”
Gun companies, he said, sell firearms to people “allowed to exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for their protection and other lawful purposes.”
The committee had also asked the gunmakers to provide information about efforts to track deaths and injuries caused by their AR-15-style weapons. All five of the gunmakers told the committee they don’t do that.
But others have tried. In 2018, a group of investors in Ruger pushed the company to report on the violence associated with its guns. The board of directors objected. But a majority of shareholders — led by a group of nuns, and supported by Ruger’s largest investor at the time, the asset firm Blackrock — passed the proposal. The vote occurred just a few months after the Parkland massacre.
Advertisement
The following year, Ruger grudgingly produced the report, which was criticized by activists for failing to include adequate details. The company said monitoring the criminal use of its products “is not feasible.” In June, a majority of shareholders approved a new resolution asking the company to study the deadliness of its products and impact on human rights.
