Susan: We should approach the information gathering on KFC in these multiple phases:

1. **General Research:** Start with a basic Google search on KFC to find the main website and relevant sources. This process would introduce the organizational structure, ownership structure, and a general institutional profile.

2. **Financial Summaries:** Look through business-oriented sites like Bloomberg, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance and Reuters, to gather important financial statistics. Market share, revenue, profits, operating costs and more, would be noted down for future reference.

3. **Key Decision Makers:** Look into KFC's organizational structure and identify key decision makers via platforms like LinkedIn, company website, notable interviews, or articles about the company. Look into their careers, past decisions, interests, and any points of leverage that can be brought forward in a negotiation.

4. **Labor Relation News:** Use Google News or news databases to find instances of labor disputes, union activities, strikes, working conditions, employee layoffs etc. Pearltrees and Google Scholar could reveal valuable academic articles on said topics.

5. **Recent Scandals:** A mix of general search and news-related search to find any recent controversies or negative press about the company, from food safety, to employee mistreatment, to environmental hazards etc.

6. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) & Sustainability:** Access the CSR or sustainability report sections of KFC’s official page, and other credible online platforms to gain insights into their social, environmental, and governance practices. This point is critical, as it can reveal both the company's commitment to ethical labor practices and any potential area of criticisms.

7. **Legal information:** Use reliable law-oriented sites to assess any legal disputes or lawsuits involving KFC.

8. **Competitor Analysis:** Brief analysis of main competitors' performance, labor practices, and public ratings can provide context on industry standards and what KFC is up against.

Once all this information is gathered, it will be synthesized and “translated” into a comprehensive yet concise report, accessible for the team.
