Susan: Sure, here's a possible strategy we can follow:

1. **Setting the Parameters**: This involves deciding exactly what is to be researched about Paramount. As the company is in the entertainment industry, reports related to their financial performance, labor relations, and key executives and stakeholders will be crucial.

2. **Financial Information research**: We will look for financial reports, which they likely publish annually. These can be sourced from their website or financial news websites. It’s also beneficial to monitor stock performance and analysis from financial experts.

3. **Key Decision Makers**: This information can be sourced from the company's website, LinkedIn and their official press releases. The objective is to identify key people in the organization, their roles, and any potential points of leverage. 

4. **Labor Relations**: Check Industrial Relations Court decisions, news websites, business reports, and forums that could highlight any history of industrial action or disputes involving Paramount employees.

5. **Scandals & other points of leverage**: Online newspapers, industry blogs, social media platforms, or any online source hosting current news or discussions about the company will be useful. These will provide information on recent controversies or scandals connected to Paramount.

6. **Data Compilation**: Finally, once all the relevant information has been gathered, it must be compiled in an objective, concise, and coherent manner.

Remember that the most recent information is often the most relevant, so it would be beneficial to sort data from newest to oldest. Also, beware of bias in reports and articles, always cross-verify facts from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
