Susan: Sure, here are the steps we need to follow to gather comprehensive information about Toyota:

1. **Company Overview**: Firstly, visit Toyota's official website to gain initial insights into the company. Understand its history, mission, philosophy, and different divisions. Look for key data on their financial results, annual reports, and operational statistics. 

2. **Key Decision Makers**: In the 'About Us' or 'Leadership' section of Toyota’s website, you will usually be able to find brief profiles on the top executives and BOD members. Also, visit their social media profiles such as LinkedIn to find more detailed professional backgrounds, shared content or posts that may indicate their business preferences and leanings.

3. **Financial Information**: Websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance and Bloomberg provide detailed financial data of companies. For Toyota, look for revenue figures, profits, net and gross margins, financial ratios, stock performance. If there are major changes in these figures over time, identify the reasons.

4. **Labor Relations**: Take the help of news portals to research on Toyota's labor relations. Websites like Reuters, BBC, The Guardian, The New York Times often carry news about major labor disputes, strikes, or unionization drives at large companies like Toyota. 

5. **Scandals**: First-person accounts of working conditions and corporate misconduct can often be found on sites like Glassdoor. For more formal allegations, check if there have been any legal cases against Toyota on websites like Justia Dockets & Filings. News related to any recent scandals can be found on news websites, that often have a specific ‘Business’ section. 

6. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Toyota's CSR initiatives can be found on their official website. Also, use CSRHub to see their CSR ratings. If they are particularly low in any area, that could be a potential point of leverage.

7. **Public Opinion and Brand Image**: Social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, can offer insight into public opinion and brand image. Look for recurring complaints or praise about specific aspects of the company.

8. **Competitors Analysis**: Understanding Toyota’s market position relative to its competitors may also provide useful leverage points. Use web tools like Alexa or SimilarWeb to get an idea of their web traffic compared to their competitors, and industry reports to understand their competitive landscape better.

9. **Regulatory Issues**: Check websites of relevant regulatory bodies for any data or instances of violation or non-compliance of rules and regulations by Toyota.

Remember to always use the most reliable sources available and to cross-reference the information you find to ensure accuracy.

In the bustling world of business, where change is the only constant, there exists a methodology that has not only withstood the test of time but has revolutionized the way we think about operations and leadership: Toyota's Kata.

As we stand on the brink of a new era in business, understanding and embracing the Toyota Kata mindset is not just an option; it's a clarion call for those who aspire to lead, innovate, and thrive in the challenges of tomorrow. Join us on this journey as we delve deep into the heart of Toyota's Kata, exploring its origins, its transformative power, and its undeniable relevance in today's dynamic business landscape.

Toyota earnings: Stock surges on boosted sales and profit outlook
Toyota says EV sales will drop but hybrids will pick up the slack

Toyota’s (TM) ADR-listed shares surged on Wednesday after the world’s largest automaker boosted its revenue and operating income forecast, citing improving operations and currency tailwinds. Toyota also raised its dividend and instituted a share buyback plan.
Toyota said it now sees sales revenue for its fiscal year 2024 at ¥43 trillion ($284.7 billion) up ¥5 trillion from its prior forecast, with operating income now rising to ¥4.5 trillion ($30 billion). “The forecast has been revised upward from the previous forecast in light of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations as well as efforts to improve profitability,” the company said in a statement.
Toyota said those efforts included cost reduction initiatives, moderating materials prices, marketing efforts to improve sales mix, and price increases will boost profits.
To that end, Toyota will also now buy back as much as ¥100 billion ($660 million) worth of shares, or 0.44% of its float, and boost its dividend by ¥30 ($0.20) a share.
Toyota did not, however, boost its global vehicle deliveries forecast, which remains at 11.38 million vehicles. While the company sees a decrease in sales due to “uncertainty” in markets such as China, the automaker sees improvements in areas like North America and other regions where a “robust market is expected” as well as in Europe where the company expects a recovery in supply.

Of note, Toyota sees its global forecast for BEV (battery electric vehicle) sales falling by nearly 40% to 123,000 vehicles, from its prior forecast of 202,000, with hybrid sales climbing to make up for the difference. Toyota did not say why it sees BEV sales falling, but it appears to be in line with what Ford and GM have been forecasting with EV demand slipping in the US due to high prices. On Tuesday, Toyota announced that it was expanding an upcoming battery plant in North Carolina with an additional investment of $8 billion, as it sees EV demand eventually climbing by 2025 in the US.
Looking at Toyota’s most recent quarter (July-September), the company reported sales revenue that hit ¥11.43 trillion ($76 billion), up 24% from a year ago, on operating income of ¥1.44 trillion ($9.5 billion), nearly tripling its level from last year. Toyota’s margin improved significantly to 11.2% from 4.7% a year ago, once again showing the effects of cost cutting, improving materials pricing, and better pricing and product mix.
“It’s a very good result, much bigger than we expected,” said Christopher Richter, senior analyst at CLSA Securities on Toyota’s performance and improved outlook. “We are in a recovery in the auto market after three years of a pandemic and the chip shortage.”

An annuity is like a personal pension plan you buy for yourself. You give an insurance company a chunk of money – say $100,000 – and in return, they promise to pay you a steady income immediately or start later. It's a way to ensure you don't run out of money in retirement, giving you regular payments for a set number of years or even for the rest of your life.

Toyota earnings: Stock surges on boosted sales and profit outlook
Toyota says EV sales will drop but hybrids will pick up the slack

Toyota’s (TM) ADR-listed shares surged on Wednesday after the world’s largest automaker boosted its revenue and operating income forecast, citing improving operations and currency tailwinds. Toyota also raised its dividend and instituted a share buyback plan.
Toyota said it now sees sales revenue for its fiscal year 2024 at ¥43 trillion ($284.7 billion) up ¥5 trillion from its prior forecast, with operating income now rising to ¥4.5 trillion ($30 billion). “The forecast has been revised upward from the previous forecast in light of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations as well as efforts to improve profitability,” the company said in a statement.
Toyota said those efforts included cost reduction initiatives, moderating materials prices, marketing efforts to improve sales mix, and price increases will boost profits.
To that end, Toyota will also now buy back as much as ¥100 billion ($660 million) worth of shares, or 0.44% of its float, and boost its dividend by ¥30 ($0.20) a share.
Toyota did not, however, boost its global vehicle deliveries forecast, which remains at 11.38 million vehicles. While the company sees a decrease in sales due to “uncertainty” in markets such as China, the automaker sees improvements in areas like North America and other regions where a “robust market is expected” as well as in Europe where the company expects a recovery in supply.

Of note, Toyota sees its global forecast for BEV (battery electric vehicle) sales falling by nearly 40% to 123,000 vehicles, from its prior forecast of 202,000, with hybrid sales climbing to make up for the difference. Toyota did not say why it sees BEV sales falling, but it appears to be in line with what Ford and GM have been forecasting with EV demand slipping in the US due to high prices. On Tuesday, Toyota announced that it was expanding an upcoming battery plant in North Carolina with an additional investment of $8 billion, as it sees EV demand eventually climbing by 2025 in the US.
Looking at Toyota’s most recent quarter (July-September), the company reported sales revenue that hit ¥11.43 trillion ($76 billion), up 24% from a year ago, on operating income of ¥1.44 trillion ($9.5 billion), nearly tripling its level from last year. Toyota’s margin improved significantly to 11.2% from 4.7% a year ago, once again showing the effects of cost cutting, improving materials pricing, and better pricing and product mix.
“It’s a very good result, much bigger than we expected,” said Christopher Richter, senior analyst at CLSA Securities on Toyota’s performance and improved outlook. “We are in a recovery in the auto market after three years of a pandemic and the chip shortage.”

Toyota remains world No.1 but its list of problems is growing

 — 
Toyota has retained its lead as the world’s biggest automaker by sales, beating German rival Volkswagen for the fourth consecutive year.
Despite the good news for Toyota (TM), it risks becoming bogged down in scandals over how it puts some of its cars through inspections, and continued fallout from a decades-old problem with exploding airbags.
The Japanese manufacturer said Tuesday it had sold a record 11.2 million vehicles worldwide in 2023, including its Daihatsu and Hino lineups. That represented an increase of 7.2% versus the previous year.
By comparison, Volkswagen Group announced earlier this month that it had delivered 9.2 million vehicles last year, up 12% compared to 2022.
The two have tussled for the title for years. In 2012, Toyota became the world’s top carmaker as it overtook General Motors in sales. Volkswagen later gained on the Japanese company, unseating Toyota in 2017.
In its Tuesday statement, Toyota attributed its growth to “solid demand in each region, in addition to easing semiconductor shortages.”
Sales in its home market of Japan surged 20.9%, while those overseas ticked up 4.1%.
Troubles at Toyota
But the Japanese behemoth may face an uphill battle this year as it grapples with growing concerns over the certifications of some of its vehicles.
On Monday, Toyota announced it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries.

Overall, 10 models use the affected engines globally, including the Land Cruiser 300 SUV and Hiace van, according to Toyota.
The company says it will now take measures to regain trust, including running new engine certification tests in the presence of regulators as needed.
The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota, halted domestic production after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.
Both scandals have raised serious questions for Toyota as a whole.
“We recognize the gravity of the fact that the repeated certification irregularities at [Toyota Industries], following those at Daihatsu, have shaken the very foundations of the company as an automobile manufacturer,” Toyota said in a Monday statement.
The group has also urged people to stop driving some of its cars in the United States and get them repaired immediately. Last week, Toyota warned owners of about 50,000 vehicles — including certain Corolla and RAV4 models dating back to 2003 — that parts of airbags could explode, causing serious injury or death.
Toyota has recalled tens of millions of cars in recent years over faulty Takata airbags. In December, Toyota also recalled about 1 million cars and SUVs in the United States due to a possible defect that could cause the passenger airbag to fail to deploy in a crash.
Growing competition
Volkswagen, too, saw growth in all regions last year, especially from Europe and North America. Deliveries in the two markets surged 19.7% and 17.9%, respectively.
China, which is the company’s biggest market, grew just 1.6%, with management citing a “challenging” environment.
Competition has become fiercer in China’s auto market — the world’s biggest — as homegrown manufacturers gain share and demand slows. Last year, Tesla (TSLA) cut prices in China to attract customers and stem slowing growth, triggering a price war that drew in dozens of automakers.
The battle has driven up sales, but threatened industry-wide profitability.

BYD has become the latest example of a company to see its bottom line affected. On Monday, the Chinese electric automaker said in a stock exchange filing that its net income likely rose by up to 86.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
While that is a sizeable increase, it represented a slowdown compared to the whopping 446% jump in profits recorded in 2022.
The news sent BYD shares down 4.4% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD has generated a lot of buzz lately after it surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) at the end of last year.
Legacy automakers are also racing to ramp up their sales of EVs. In 2023, Volkswagen logged a nearly 35% jump in sales of fully electric vehicles, selling 771,100 units.
That compared with 104,000 battery-powered vehicles sold by Toyota, which has long lagged behind in the global EV race. The company, which is a leader of hybrid cars, sold 3.7 million electric vehicles total in 2023 when including hybrids.

Toyota accepts union demands for biggest wage hike in two decades

 — 
Toyota Motor, the world’s biggest automaker, said on Wednesday it would accept a union demand for the biggest base salary increase in 20 years and a rise in bonus payments, as Japan steps up calls for businesses to hike pay.
As one of Japan’s biggest employers, Toyota (TM) has long served as a bellwether of the spring labor talks, which are in full swing at major companies. Many are expected to conclude swiftly as the government seeks inflation-beating wage hikes to ease burdens on consumers.
The automaker’s incoming president Koji Sato said the decision to accept the union’s demands in full at the first round of talks was meant not just for Toyota but “also for the industry as a whole, and in the hope that it will lead to frank discussions between labor and management at each company.”
Within hours of Toyota’s announcement, rival Honda (HMC) Motor said it had agreed to union demands for a 5% pay increase. The average monthly base salary rise of 12,500 yen ($92.70) at Honda (HMC) is the biggest jump since at least 1990.
Japan's workers haven't had a raise in 30 years. Companies are under pressure to pay up
Toyota and the union federation representing 357,000 Toyota group workers said the base pay rise was the biggest in two decades, though they both declined to provide the percentage increase.
With inflation running at around 4%, the highest level in 40 years following decades of deflation, Japan is under more pressure than ever before to raise wages to revive consumption.
But with the economy struggling, it averted recession in the fourth quarter but grew much less than expected, analysts say pay increases will remain limited to big firms, such as Toyota.
Small and medium-sized companies, which employ most Japanese workers, will struggle to afford pay rises, they say.
Successful talks
Toyota said its wage increase would also apply to part-time workers and senior contract workers. It had agreed to union’s request for one-off bonus payments worth 6.7 months of wages.
Takaaki Sakagami, deputy secretary-general of the Federation of All Toyota Workers’ Union, said the union was pleased it had been able to reach a deal with the company quickly.
The pay agreement comes as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stepped up calls on business leaders to accelerate wage increases, warning of a return to stagflation if pay rises fall short of the rapid increase in prices.
“We will boost consumption and expand domestic demand by promoting efforts toward structural wage increases,” Kishida said at a lower house budget committee session on Wednesday.
Fast Retailing (FRCOF), which owns clothing giant Uniqlo, last month said it would boost pay by up to 40%, fueling expectations big manufacturers would offer more at annual wage talks with unions this spring.
Video game maker Nintendo (NTDOF) said earlier this month that it planned to lift workers’ base pay by 10%, despite trimming its full-year profit forecast.

Toyota Motor Corp. has increased wages of production and skilled-trades autoworkers after the United Auto Workers detailed wage and benefits gains in tentative agreements with the Detroit Three automakers that it wants to take to other companies as part of organizing efforts.
Toyota spokesperson Scott Vazin said the company isn't sharing details of the wage increases announced on Tuesday publicly, but a flyer circulating on social media showed starting next year, top-wage production workers would see a new wage rate of $34.80 per hour and skilled trades employees' would max at $43.20 per hour. The automaker also decreased its timeline to the top pay to four years from eight.
According to Toyota's website, the company has 14 manufacturing plants in North America and employs more than 32,000 workers.

“At Toyota, we take great pride in showing respect for people," Chris Reynolds, executive vice president of corporate resources at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. "We value our employees and their contributions, and we show it by offering robust compensation packages that we continually review to ensure that we remain competitive within the automotive industry."
A new fall wage effective Sept. 25, according to the flyer, includes a 2%, 25-cent increase to $31.86 per hour for top-paid production workers and a 0.6%, 25-cent increase for top-paid skilled trade members to $39.50. The next wage increases effective Jan. 1 are 9.2% and 9.4%, respectively.

Meanwhile, workers starting at Toyota still would begin at $21.70, according to the flyer.
On Monday, the UAW reached a tentative agreement with General Motors Co. that ended a 46-day-long strike against the Detroit automaker and marked the union's third deal with the Detroit Three automakers within a week.
The GM, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV deals include 25% in base wage increases through April 2028. They all are slated to cumulatively raise the top wage by 33% to more than $42 an hour when accounting for cost-of-living adjustments, according to the union.
UAW members at all three automakers still have to vote on the contracts.

The UAW won big in the auto strike — but what does it mean for the rest of us?

UAW members attend a solidarity rally in Detroit on Sept 15, 2023. The union struck lucrative new deals with each of the Big Three automakers. The UAW now wants to use the momentum to unionize foreign automakers as well as Tesla.
Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
The United Auto Workers staged an unprecedented strike against the Big Three Detroit automakers — and they emerged with three big, lucrative deals. But the wider impact on the rest of the country is much less clear.
Those contracts will clearly benefit UAW workers. If ratified by members, the new contracts would lock in raises in wages of at least 25% — and for some temps of as much as 168% — as well as boost retirement contributions and other benefits.
But here's what these contracts means for car buyers and the economy — and also Tesla.
UAW workers
For the approximately 150,000 workers covered by these contracts, these deals are, obviously, a big deal. (Workers are currently voting on whether to ratify the contracts, or push for even better.)
Sponsor Message
In these talks, the UAW was determined to make up for all the pay and benefits members gave up in years past, and to make a job at a unionized auto plant once again a ticket for a for a secure, middle-class lifestyle.
And many workers — though not all — believe the deals will provide just that.
"It's going to be able to change the trajectory of my life," says Brandon Bell, a worker at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant who will see his hourly pay go from $20 to $35 by this December if the contract is ratified.
"All the prices and cost of living has gone up so much. I don't have to worry about it as much now," he added.
Auto companies and suppliers
Gone are the days when the Big Three automakers dominated the U.S. market. These new contracts will push up labor costs significantly for companies that already spend much more on their workers than their non-unionized rivals.
That is a significant disadvantage in a fiercely competitive industry.
On the other hand, Detroit automakers knew coming into these strikes that they'd need to pay their workers more. Pay has not kept pace with inflation, and labor costs are rising everywhere.
"It certainly is a disadvantage," argues Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital, "but I actually don't think this is going to be as painful as many kind of are speculating that it will be."
It's a headwind, he says, but not a "death knell."
After the deals were struck, Ford and Stellantis have both told investors they're confident about their future profits.
Meanwhile, the union's wage gains will indirectly affect non-unionized companies, too, by pressuring them to raise their pay.
BUSINESS
How Shawn Fain, an unlikely and outspoken president, led the UAW to strike
That includes non-unionized assembly plants, but also the suppliers who sell parts to those plants, says Ann Marie Uetz, a lawyer who works with lots of automotive suppliers.
"It's a super tight labor market right now — very tough to get skilled labor," Uetz says. Now workers are eying the UAW's big raises, "and so those skilled trades are going to be looking at their employers in the supply base and saying, 'Pay me more.'"
That will ultimately ripple up to the automakers — unionized and otherwise — in the form of higher costs for components.

Car shoppers
Higher pay for auto workers means higher costs for the Big Three automakers, and those costs will need to be absorbed somewhere.
Ford has indicated that the new deal will eventually add $850-900 to the cost of making each of its vehicles.
Analysts, though, caution it won't be easy to raise prices further at a time when car prices have already surged.
"Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time, but given that affordability is already a challenge for the market, the automakers will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs to buyers," writes Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox.
New car prices rose 30% after the pandemic started. The average new vehicle is now close to $50,000.
BUSINESS
Why car prices are still so high — and why they are unlikely to fall anytime soon
That increase was driven by supply and demand, and by automakers' decisions to focus on building more of their higher-end vehicles, not by labor costs or any other costs. And just as prices have stabilized and even started to fall, interest rates are rising, which makes it more expensive to finance a vehicle ... and harder for companies to raise prices.
Another option: They could cut their expenses elsewhere to make up for added labor costs.
Or, the union always notes, they could just accept a smaller profit — although for the companies that would be be the option of last resort.
The broader economy
The deals will inject a lot of money into the communities around UAW auto plants — just in time for the holidays, Cox economist Jonathan Smoke notes.
They will also push up wages, both in the auto industry and other sectors, through competitive pressure.
Of course, the downside is that rising wages and any increase in auto prices would put upward pressure on inflation, complicating the Fed's fight for an economic soft landing.

Some analysts have also cautioned that the lucrative deals for the UAW could backfire — by being so rich that it creates an incentive for companies to shift assembly jobs to other locations, like Canada or Mexico, or invest even more in automation.
The calculations aren't simple, notes S&P Global Mobility's Michael Robinet. "Every time a vehicle manufacturer and or supplier evaluates whether they want to make a vehicle or a component," he says. "there's lots of factors that work into it."
Labor cost is not the only factor — but it's one of them.
Patty Ellison, a former Stellantis assembly line worker who now works at a Mopar parts warehouse in Michigan, says she's not worried that the contract will shift more jobs to other countries or to robots.
"That's something that we've all dealt with in the automotive industry for forever, basically," she said. "It's just the nature of the business."
The UAW's power
The UAW's fiery, ambitious new president, Shawn Fain, has framed talks with the automakers as a war between the working class and the billionaire class. And these eye-catching new contracts were just the first volley.
The next battle? Expanding, by organizing foreign automakers as well as the disruptive U.S. automaker that dominates the growing EV sector — Tesla.
In terms of foreign automakers, a lot of these efforts will be concentrated in the South.
Detroit may still be known as the Motor City, but since the '80s, the South has attracted more than a dozen assembly plants from foreign automakers like BMW and Hyundai, employing tens of thousands of workers.
Most of them are not unionized — and changing that will be a big challenge.
The UAW has a long history of failure to unionize new plants. It didn't help that for years it was trying to organize plants while also grappling with a corruption scandal that sent several of its leaders to prison for embezzlement and accepting bribes from companies.
The union has made big pushes in the South before, at Mercedes in Alabama, Volkswagen in Tennessee and Nissan in Mississippi.
"There was a lot of money spent, and there was a lot of effort. But they went 0-for-3," says Stephen Silvia, who wrote a book about the UAW's attempts to organize in the South, where right-to-work laws and anti-union political leaders are major obstacles.
ECONOMY
UAW sets its sights on unionizing foreign auto plants in the South
The UAW is hoping that the wind is at its back this time. After all, it has just secured record contracts for its members. It's got new leadership. Other unions are also scoring big wins in an economy that gives more leverage to workers. And broader public support for unions is higher than it's been in years.
And even if the UAW fails to unionize other foreign automakers, the workers at those companies could benefit nonetheless.
Automakers have an incentive to keep their pay high enough to dissuade a union push in their plants. Already, Toyota has given its U.S. autoworkers a 9% pay raise since the UAW struck a deal.
Fain nodded to those raises, telling Toyota workers the UAW stands for "U Are Welcome."
Tesla
But of all the potential UAW targets, perhaps none would be more more attractive than unionizing Tesla.
Here, too, the union has previously tried hard and fallen short.
Tesla's first assembly plant, in Fremont, Calif., is far from the right-to-work South, but repeated unionization pushes still failed to gain traction.
BUSINESS
Elon Musk dares United Autoworkers to try to unionize Tesla
There are several factors. Tesla staff, including assembly line workers, get stock options, which is highly unusual in the auto industry.
That stock can be volatile — Tesla shares had a terrible 2022 — but can also be incredibly lucrative. An employee who held Tesla stock for the last five years has seen its value increase 191%. That makes it hard to compare Tesla's compensation to other automakers.
Elon Musk is personally opposed to the UAW, which he says destroys productivity. He has also accused the union of betraying and embezzling from workers, a reference to the corruption of former UAW leaders.
And Tesla has dissuaded unionization, through legal methods as well as those deemed illegal.
For now, these contracts give Tesla an even greater cost advantage as the legacy automakers embark an a high-stakes effort to scale up their EV production and catch up with Tesla's lead.

Toyota remains world No.1 but its list of problems is growing

 — 
Toyota has retained its lead as the world’s biggest automaker by sales, beating German rival Volkswagen for the fourth consecutive year.
Despite the good news for Toyota (TM), it risks becoming bogged down in scandals over how it puts some of its cars through inspections, and continued fallout from a decades-old problem with exploding airbags.
The Japanese manufacturer said Tuesday it had sold a record 11.2 million vehicles worldwide in 2023, including its Daihatsu and Hino lineups. That represented an increase of 7.2% versus the previous year.
By comparison, Volkswagen Group announced earlier this month that it had delivered 9.2 million vehicles last year, up 12% compared to 2022.
The two have tussled for the title for years. In 2012, Toyota became the world’s top carmaker as it overtook General Motors in sales. Volkswagen later gained on the Japanese company, unseating Toyota in 2017.
In its Tuesday statement, Toyota attributed its growth to “solid demand in each region, in addition to easing semiconductor shortages.”
Sales in its home market of Japan surged 20.9%, while those overseas ticked up 4.1%.
Troubles at Toyota
But the Japanese behemoth may face an uphill battle this year as it grapples with growing concerns over the certifications of some of its vehicles.
On Monday, Toyota announced it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries.
RELATED ARTICLE
Toyota halts shipment of 10 models over diesel engine testing issues
Overall, 10 models use the affected engines globally, including the Land Cruiser 300 SUV and Hiace van, according to Toyota.
The company says it will now take measures to regain trust, including running new engine certification tests in the presence of regulators as needed.
The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota, halted domestic production after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.
Both scandals have raised serious questions for Toyota as a whole.
“We recognize the gravity of the fact that the repeated certification irregularities at [Toyota Industries], following those at Daihatsu, have shaken the very foundations of the company as an automobile manufacturer,” Toyota said in a Monday statement.
The group has also urged people to stop driving some of its cars in the United States and get them repaired immediately. Last week, Toyota warned owners of about 50,000 vehicles — including certain Corolla and RAV4 models dating back to 2003 — that parts of airbags could explode, causing serious injury or death.
Toyota has recalled tens of millions of cars in recent years over faulty Takata airbags. In December, Toyota also recalled about 1 million cars and SUVs in the United States due to a possible defect that could cause the passenger airbag to fail to deploy in a crash.
Growing competition
Volkswagen, too, saw growth in all regions last year, especially from Europe and North America. Deliveries in the two markets surged 19.7% and 17.9%, respectively.
China, which is the company’s biggest market, grew just 1.6%, with management citing a “challenging” environment.
Competition has become fiercer in China’s auto market — the world’s biggest — as homegrown manufacturers gain share and demand slows. Last year, Tesla (TSLA) cut prices in China to attract customers and stem slowing growth, triggering a price war that drew in dozens of automakers.
The battle has driven up sales, but threatened industry-wide profitability.

BYD has become the latest example of a company to see its bottom line affected. On Monday, the Chinese electric automaker said in a stock exchange filing that its net income likely rose by up to 86.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
While that is a sizeable increase, it represented a slowdown compared to the whopping 446% jump in profits recorded in 2022.
The news sent BYD shares down 4.4% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD has generated a lot of buzz lately after it surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) at the end of last year.
Legacy automakers are also racing to ramp up their sales of EVs. In 2023, Volkswagen logged a nearly 35% jump in sales of fully electric vehicles, selling 771,100 units.
That compared with 104,000 battery-powered vehicles sold by Toyota, which has long lagged behind in the global EV race. The company, which is a leader of hybrid cars, sold 3.7 million electric vehicles total in 2023 when including hybrids.

Toyota accepts union demands for biggest wage hike in two decades

 — 
Toyota Motor, the world’s biggest automaker, said on Wednesday it would accept a union demand for the biggest base salary increase in 20 years and a rise in bonus payments, as Japan steps up calls for businesses to hike pay.
As one of Japan’s biggest employers, Toyota (TM) has long served as a bellwether of the spring labor talks, which are in full swing at major companies. Many are expected to conclude swiftly as the government seeks inflation-beating wage hikes to ease burdens on consumers.
The automaker’s incoming president Koji Sato said the decision to accept the union’s demands in full at the first round of talks was meant not just for Toyota but “also for the industry as a whole, and in the hope that it will lead to frank discussions between labor and management at each company.”
Within hours of Toyota’s announcement, rival Honda (HMC) Motor said it had agreed to union demands for a 5% pay increase. The average monthly base salary rise of 12,500 yen ($92.70) at Honda (HMC) is the biggest jump since at least 1990.
Japan's workers haven't had a raise in 30 years. Companies are under pressure to pay up
Toyota and the union federation representing 357,000 Toyota group workers said the base pay rise was the biggest in two decades, though they both declined to provide the percentage increase.
With inflation running at around 4%, the highest level in 40 years following decades of deflation, Japan is under more pressure than ever before to raise wages to revive consumption.
But with the economy struggling, it averted recession in the fourth quarter but grew much less than expected, analysts say pay increases will remain limited to big firms, such as Toyota.
Small and medium-sized companies, which employ most Japanese workers, will struggle to afford pay rises, they say.
Successful talks
Toyota said its wage increase would also apply to part-time workers and senior contract workers. It had agreed to union’s request for one-off bonus payments worth 6.7 months of wages.
Takaaki Sakagami, deputy secretary-general of the Federation of All Toyota Workers’ Union, said the union was pleased it had been able to reach a deal with the company quickly.
The pay agreement comes as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stepped up calls on business leaders to accelerate wage increases, warning of a return to stagflation if pay rises fall short of the rapid increase in prices.
“We will boost consumption and expand domestic demand by promoting efforts toward structural wage increases,” Kishida said at a lower house budget committee session on Wednesday.
Fast Retailing (FRCOF), which owns clothing giant Uniqlo, last month said it would boost pay by up to 40%, fueling expectations big manufacturers would offer more at annual wage talks with unions this spring.
Video game maker Nintendo (NTDOF) said earlier this month that it planned to lift workers’ base pay by 10%, despite trimming its full-year profit forecast.

Toyota Motor Corp. has increased wages of production and skilled-trades autoworkers after the United Auto Workers detailed wage and benefits gains in tentative agreements with the Detroit Three automakers that it wants to take to other companies as part of organizing efforts.
Toyota spokesperson Scott Vazin said the company isn't sharing details of the wage increases announced on Tuesday publicly, but a flyer circulating on social media showed starting next year, top-wage production workers would see a new wage rate of $34.80 per hour and skilled trades employees' would max at $43.20 per hour. The automaker also decreased its timeline to the top pay to four years from eight.
According to Toyota's website, the company has 14 manufacturing plants in North America and employs more than 32,000 workers.

“At Toyota, we take great pride in showing respect for people," Chris Reynolds, executive vice president of corporate resources at Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. "We value our employees and their contributions, and we show it by offering robust compensation packages that we continually review to ensure that we remain competitive within the automotive industry."
A new fall wage effective Sept. 25, according to the flyer, includes a 2%, 25-cent increase to $31.86 per hour for top-paid production workers and a 0.6%, 25-cent increase for top-paid skilled trade members to $39.50. The next wage increases effective Jan. 1 are 9.2% and 9.4%, respectively.

Meanwhile, workers starting at Toyota still would begin at $21.70, according to the flyer.
On Monday, the UAW reached a tentative agreement with General Motors Co. that ended a 46-day-long strike against the Detroit automaker and marked the union's third deal with the Detroit Three automakers within a week.
The GM, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV deals include 25% in base wage increases through April 2028. They all are slated to cumulatively raise the top wage by 33% to more than $42 an hour when accounting for cost-of-living adjustments, according to the union.
UAW members at all three automakers still have to vote on the contracts.

The UAW won big in the auto strike — but what does it mean for the rest of us?

UAW members attend a solidarity rally in Detroit on Sept 15, 2023. The union struck lucrative new deals with each of the Big Three automakers. The UAW now wants to use the momentum to unionize foreign automakers as well as Tesla.
Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
The United Auto Workers staged an unprecedented strike against the Big Three Detroit automakers — and they emerged with three big, lucrative deals. But the wider impact on the rest of the country is much less clear.
Those contracts will clearly benefit UAW workers. If ratified by members, the new contracts would lock in raises in wages of at least 25% — and for some temps of as much as 168% — as well as boost retirement contributions and other benefits.
But here's what these contracts means for car buyers and the economy — and also Tesla.
UAW workers
For the approximately 150,000 workers covered by these contracts, these deals are, obviously, a big deal. (Workers are currently voting on whether to ratify the contracts, or push for even better.)
Sponsor Message
In these talks, the UAW was determined to make up for all the pay and benefits members gave up in years past, and to make a job at a unionized auto plant once again a ticket for a for a secure, middle-class lifestyle.
And many workers — though not all — believe the deals will provide just that.
"It's going to be able to change the trajectory of my life," says Brandon Bell, a worker at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant who will see his hourly pay go from $20 to $35 by this December if the contract is ratified.
"All the prices and cost of living has gone up so much. I don't have to worry about it as much now," he added.
Auto companies and suppliers
Gone are the days when the Big Three automakers dominated the U.S. market. These new contracts will push up labor costs significantly for companies that already spend much more on their workers than their non-unionized rivals.
That is a significant disadvantage in a fiercely competitive industry.
On the other hand, Detroit automakers knew coming into these strikes that they'd need to pay their workers more. Pay has not kept pace with inflation, and labor costs are rising everywhere.
"It certainly is a disadvantage," argues Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital, "but I actually don't think this is going to be as painful as many kind of are speculating that it will be."
It's a headwind, he says, but not a "death knell."
After the deals were struck, Ford and Stellantis have both told investors they're confident about their future profits.
Meanwhile, the union's wage gains will indirectly affect non-unionized companies, too, by pressuring them to raise their pay.
BUSINESS
How Shawn Fain, an unlikely and outspoken president, led the UAW to strike
That includes non-unionized assembly plants, but also the suppliers who sell parts to those plants, says Ann Marie Uetz, a lawyer who works with lots of automotive suppliers.
"It's a super tight labor market right now — very tough to get skilled labor," Uetz says. Now workers are eying the UAW's big raises, "and so those skilled trades are going to be looking at their employers in the supply base and saying, 'Pay me more.'"
That will ultimately ripple up to the automakers — unionized and otherwise — in the form of higher costs for components.

Car shoppers
Higher pay for auto workers means higher costs for the Big Three automakers, and those costs will need to be absorbed somewhere.
Ford has indicated that the new deal will eventually add $850-900 to the cost of making each of its vehicles.
Analysts, though, caution it won't be easy to raise prices further at a time when car prices have already surged.
"Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time, but given that affordability is already a challenge for the market, the automakers will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs to buyers," writes Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox.
New car prices rose 30% after the pandemic started. The average new vehicle is now close to $50,000.
BUSINESS
Why car prices are still so high — and why they are unlikely to fall anytime soon
That increase was driven by supply and demand, and by automakers' decisions to focus on building more of their higher-end vehicles, not by labor costs or any other costs. And just as prices have stabilized and even started to fall, interest rates are rising, which makes it more expensive to finance a vehicle ... and harder for companies to raise prices.
Another option: They could cut their expenses elsewhere to make up for added labor costs.
Or, the union always notes, they could just accept a smaller profit — although for the companies that would be be the option of last resort.
The broader economy
The deals will inject a lot of money into the communities around UAW auto plants — just in time for the holidays, Cox economist Jonathan Smoke notes.
They will also push up wages, both in the auto industry and other sectors, through competitive pressure.
Of course, the downside is that rising wages and any increase in auto prices would put upward pressure on inflation, complicating the Fed's fight for an economic soft landing.

Some analysts have also cautioned that the lucrative deals for the UAW could backfire — by being so rich that it creates an incentive for companies to shift assembly jobs to other locations, like Canada or Mexico, or invest even more in automation.
The calculations aren't simple, notes S&P Global Mobility's Michael Robinet. "Every time a vehicle manufacturer and or supplier evaluates whether they want to make a vehicle or a component," he says. "there's lots of factors that work into it."
Labor cost is not the only factor — but it's one of them.
Patty Ellison, a former Stellantis assembly line worker who now works at a Mopar parts warehouse in Michigan, says she's not worried that the contract will shift more jobs to other countries or to robots.
"That's something that we've all dealt with in the automotive industry for forever, basically," she said. "It's just the nature of the business."
The UAW's power
The UAW's fiery, ambitious new president, Shawn Fain, has framed talks with the automakers as a war between the working class and the billionaire class. And these eye-catching new contracts were just the first volley.
The next battle? Expanding, by organizing foreign automakers as well as the disruptive U.S. automaker that dominates the growing EV sector — Tesla.
In terms of foreign automakers, a lot of these efforts will be concentrated in the South.
Detroit may still be known as the Motor City, but since the '80s, the South has attracted more than a dozen assembly plants from foreign automakers like BMW and Hyundai, employing tens of thousands of workers.
Most of them are not unionized — and changing that will be a big challenge.
The UAW has a long history of failure to unionize new plants. It didn't help that for years it was trying to organize plants while also grappling with a corruption scandal that sent several of its leaders to prison for embezzlement and accepting bribes from companies.
The union has made big pushes in the South before, at Mercedes in Alabama, Volkswagen in Tennessee and Nissan in Mississippi.
"There was a lot of money spent, and there was a lot of effort. But they went 0-for-3," says Stephen Silvia, who wrote a book about the UAW's attempts to organize in the South, where right-to-work laws and anti-union political leaders are major obstacles.
ECONOMY
UAW sets its sights on unionizing foreign auto plants in the South
The UAW is hoping that the wind is at its back this time. After all, it has just secured record contracts for its members. It's got new leadership. Other unions are also scoring big wins in an economy that gives more leverage to workers. And broader public support for unions is higher than it's been in years.
And even if the UAW fails to unionize other foreign automakers, the workers at those companies could benefit nonetheless.
Automakers have an incentive to keep their pay high enough to dissuade a union push in their plants. Already, Toyota has given its U.S. autoworkers a 9% pay raise since the UAW struck a deal.
Fain nodded to those raises, telling Toyota workers the UAW stands for "U Are Welcome."
Tesla
But of all the potential UAW targets, perhaps none would be more more attractive than unionizing Tesla.
Here, too, the union has previously tried hard and fallen short.
Tesla's first assembly plant, in Fremont, Calif., is far from the right-to-work South, but repeated unionization pushes still failed to gain traction.
BUSINESS
Elon Musk dares United Autoworkers to try to unionize Tesla
There are several factors. Tesla staff, including assembly line workers, get stock options, which is highly unusual in the auto industry.
That stock can be volatile — Tesla shares had a terrible 2022 — but can also be incredibly lucrative. An employee who held Tesla stock for the last five years has seen its value increase 191%. That makes it hard to compare Tesla's compensation to other automakers.
Elon Musk is personally opposed to the UAW, which he says destroys productivity. He has also accused the union of betraying and embezzling from workers, a reference to the corruption of former UAW leaders.
And Tesla has dissuaded unionization, through legal methods as well as those deemed illegal.
For now, these contracts give Tesla an even greater cost advantage as the legacy automakers embark an a high-stakes effort to scale up their EV production and catch up with Tesla's lead.

Toyota remains world No.1 but its list of problems is growing

 — 
Toyota has retained its lead as the world’s biggest automaker by sales, beating German rival Volkswagen for the fourth consecutive year.
Despite the good news for Toyota (TM), it risks becoming bogged down in scandals over how it puts some of its cars through inspections, and continued fallout from a decades-old problem with exploding airbags.
The Japanese manufacturer said Tuesday it had sold a record 11.2 million vehicles worldwide in 2023, including its Daihatsu and Hino lineups. That represented an increase of 7.2% versus the previous year.
By comparison, Volkswagen Group announced earlier this month that it had delivered 9.2 million vehicles last year, up 12% compared to 2022.
The two have tussled for the title for years. In 2012, Toyota became the world’s top carmaker as it overtook General Motors in sales. Volkswagen later gained on the Japanese company, unseating Toyota in 2017.
In its Tuesday statement, Toyota attributed its growth to “solid demand in each region, in addition to easing semiconductor shortages.”
Sales in its home market of Japan surged 20.9%, while those overseas ticked up 4.1%.
Troubles at Toyota
But the Japanese behemoth may face an uphill battle this year as it grapples with growing concerns over the certifications of some of its vehicles.
On Monday, Toyota announced it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries.

Overall, 10 models use the affected engines globally, including the Land Cruiser 300 SUV and Hiace van, according to Toyota.
The company says it will now take measures to regain trust, including running new engine certification tests in the presence of regulators as needed.
The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota, halted domestic production after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.
Both scandals have raised serious questions for Toyota as a whole.
“We recognize the gravity of the fact that the repeated certification irregularities at [Toyota Industries], following those at Daihatsu, have shaken the very foundations of the company as an automobile manufacturer,” Toyota said in a Monday statement.
The group has also urged people to stop driving some of its cars in the United States and get them repaired immediately. Last week, Toyota warned owners of about 50,000 vehicles — including certain Corolla and RAV4 models dating back to 2003 — that parts of airbags could explode, causing serious injury or death.
Toyota has recalled tens of millions of cars in recent years over faulty Takata airbags. In December, Toyota also recalled about 1 million cars and SUVs in the United States due to a possible defect that could cause the passenger airbag to fail to deploy in a crash.
Growing competition
Volkswagen, too, saw growth in all regions last year, especially from Europe and North America. Deliveries in the two markets surged 19.7% and 17.9%, respectively.
China, which is the company’s biggest market, grew just 1.6%, with management citing a “challenging” environment.
Competition has become fiercer in China’s auto market — the world’s biggest — as homegrown manufacturers gain share and demand slows. Last year, Tesla (TSLA) cut prices in China to attract customers and stem slowing growth, triggering a price war that drew in dozens of automakers.
The battle has driven up sales, but threatened industry-wide profitability.

BYD has become the latest example of a company to see its bottom line affected. On Monday, the Chinese electric automaker said in a stock exchange filing that its net income likely rose by up to 86.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
While that is a sizeable increase, it represented a slowdown compared to the whopping 446% jump in profits recorded in 2022.
The news sent BYD shares down 4.4% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD has generated a lot of buzz lately after it surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) at the end of last year.
Legacy automakers are also racing to ramp up their sales of EVs. In 2023, Volkswagen logged a nearly 35% jump in sales of fully electric vehicles, selling 771,100 units.
That compared with 104,000 battery-powered vehicles sold by Toyota, which has long lagged behind in the global EV race. The company, which is a leader of hybrid cars, sold 3.7 million electric vehicles total in 2023 when including hybrids.

Toyota apologizes for cheating on vehicle testing and halts production of three models

TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda apologized Monday for massive cheating on certification tests for seven vehicle models as the automaker suspended production of three of them.
The wide-ranging fraudulent testing at Japan’s top automaker involved the use of inadequate or outdated data in collision tests, and incorrect testing of airbag inflation and rear-seat damage in crashes. Engine power tests were also found to have been falsified.
Toyota Motor Corp., based in Toyota city, central Japan, suspended production in the country of the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross. The deceptive tests were also found on discontinued models.
The company said the wrongdoing does not affect the safety of the vehicles already on roads, which include the Corolla subcompact and Lexus luxury vehicles.
“We sincerely apologize,” Toyoda told reporters, bowing deeply and holding the position for several seconds, as is customary in Japan at news conferences where companies apologize for misbehavior.
A Japanese government investigation into Toyota began in January. The issue does not affect Toyota’s overseas production.

Also Monday, Toyota’s Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp. reported similar irregular certification testing, and halted production of two models, the Roadster and Mazda 2. It said incorrect engine control software was used in the tests.
Mazda, based in the southwestern city of Hiroshima, also acknowledged violations on crash tests on three discontinued models. None of the violations affect the vehicles’ safety.
Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co. also apologized Monday for improper tests, such as those on noise levels and torque, on a range of models. Honda said affected older models — the Accord, Odyssey and Fit — are no longer in production. The safety of the vehicles is not affected, it said.
Certification problems starting surfacing two years ago at Toyota group companies, truck maker Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. — specializing in small models — and Toyota Industries Corp., which makes machinery and auto parts.
Shinji Miyamoto, a Toyota executive overseeing customer satisfaction, said Toyota began looking into its own tests following the problems at the group companies.
The apparent unraveling of the testing systems at Toyota and its group companies is an embarrassment for an automaker that’s prided itself for decades on production finesse and a corporate culture based on empowering workers to make “ever-better cars.”
Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, suggested some certification rules might be overly stringent, noting such tests differed around the world. But he repeatedly said he wasn’t condoning the violations.
“We are not a perfect company. But if we see anything wrong, we will take a step back and keep trying to correct it,” said Toyoda.
He said the company may have been too eager to get the tests done and abbreviated them at a time when model varieties were burgeoning.
Toyota sells more than 10 million vehicles around the world.

Toyota quality scandal widens as 10 models found to have rigged data
By Yuki Yamaguchi, KYODO NEWS - Jan 29, 2024 - 21:48 | All, Japan
 Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that power output data had been manipulated for 10 of its models sold globally, in a new blow to the world's biggest automaker group, which has been plagued by a series of quality control issues in recent years.
Its affiliate  Toyota Industries Corp. fabricated the data on diesel engines it makes and supplies for the automaker, Toyota said, adding that it will suspend shipment of the affected vehicles, including the Land Cruiser 300 and the Hilux.
"We sincerely apologize for causing tremendous trouble to our customers," Toyota President Koji Sato told reporters in Tokyo, adding the automaker will do all it can to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.
The revelation comes as a number of quality issues have been shaking the group's foundation.

Toyota's small-car unit Daihatsu Motor Co. stopped all shipments at home and abroad last month after a third-party investigation found that safety tests for most of its models were rigged.
Hino Motors Ltd., another Toyota subsidiary, admitted in March 2022 to submitting fraudulent emissions and fuel economy data to transport authorities.
The 10 models also include the Hiace, the Fortuner and the Innova. The cars were sold in Japan, Europe and the Middle East, among other markets. The output data rigging dates back to 2017, Toyota Industries said.
"We feel deeply responsible for the misconduct, which persisted for a long time, and for failing to discover and rectify it," Toyota Industries President Koichi Ito said at a press conference. "We will do our utmost to rebuild the company with legal compliance as our top priority."
Toyota has decided to stop six production lines at four of its domestic factories until Feb. 1 due to the shipment halt, it said.
Toyota Industries doctored the volume of fuel injection in engine output tests in a bid to make the engines' torque, or rotational force, appear better than it was, according to a report by a third-party panel.
The panel blamed the company's corporate culture, saying it lacked the will to actively increase compliance amid an environment where it felt secure in its position as a Toyota supplier.
"Its data compliance has grown lax," Hiroshi Inoue, the head of the panel, said at a separate press conference.
Toyota said it has confirmed the affected engines and that following a reevaluation after the discovery of the rigging, the vehicles now comply with engine output standards.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said the problem shakes the foundation of the automobile certification system, instructing Toyota Industries to find out the cause of the problem. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also said it will launch an on-site inspection at the company's factory in Aichi Prefecture on Tuesday.
Monday's announcement followed a revelation in March last year when Toyota Industries admitted to falsifying emissions data for its forklift engines. The third-party panel has been investigating the issue.
On Monday, Toyota Industries said the data rigging was found in more of its forklift  engines, and it has stopped shipment of all the affected products.

Toyota raided as safety testing scandal grows

The scandal involving Toyota has shaken up the Japanese car industry
Japan's transport ministry raided the headquarters of motor giant Toyota on Tuesday, as a scandal over faulty safety data escalated.
The world's largest carmaker has apologised for providing incorrect or manipulated data for safety certification tests.
The scandal has shaken the Japanese car industry, with rivals Honda, Mazda and Suzuki also admitting to submitting faulty data.
Toyota sold more than 11 million passenger vehicles in 2023.
It has said the findings do not affect the safety of vehicles already on the road.
The company has suspended the production of three car models - the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross.
It has also been accused of using modified vehicles during safety collision tests, for vehicles that are no longer in production.
The raids come a day after Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda apologised to customers and car enthusiasts.
He bowed deeply and held the position for a few seconds, which is customary in Japan when companies apologise for wrongdoing.
"We neglected the certification process and mass produced our cars without first taking the proper precautionary steps,” Mr Toyoda said.

Japanese carmakers Honda, Mazda and Suzuki are also due to be inspected by the authorities over the same issue.
Honda said it found wrongdoing on tests related to noise and engine power, but it has stressed that its vehicles are safe to drive.
Mazda has halted the shipments of some cars and said it will bear the cost to its suppliers.
However, the company added that it is not planning on issuing recalls.
The findings also apply to one Suzuki car model that is no longer being produced.
Last December, Toyota-owned carmaker Daihatsu closed all of its factories for more than a month, after admitting that it had falsified safety tests.
Some of the cars were sold with Toyota branding.
Daihatsu compensated more than 400 domestic suppliers during the period where its plants were idle.

Toyota halts some shipments as Japan’s auto safety scandal widens

Tokyo — A safety test scandal at Japanese automakers widened Monday, with Toyota Motor and Mazda both halting shipments of some vehicles after Japan’s transport ministry found irregularities in applications to certify certain models.
The irregularities were also found in applications from Honda (HMC), Suzuki and Yamaha Motor, the ministry said. The automakers were found to have submitted incorrect or manipulated safety test data when they applied for certification of the vehicles.
The ministry ordered Toyota (TM), the world’s biggest carmaker by the number of vehicles sold, Mazda and Yamaha to suspend shipments of some vehicles.
The latest revelations came after the ministry asked automakers in January to investigate certification applications following a safety test scandal at Toyota’s Daihatsu compact car unit that emerged last year.
Monday’s developments are also likely to heighten focus on Toyota’s annual general meeting later this month. Influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against re-electing Akio Toyoda as chairman at the meeting.
In a report to shareholders, ISS singled out the “spate of certification irregularities” at the Toyota Group.
Toyoda, the grandson of the automaker’s founder, told journalists Monday: “As the person in charge of the Toyota Group, I would like to sincerely apologize to our customers, to car fans, and all stakeholders for this.”
He said the cars had not gone through the correct certification process before being sold. Toyota said it had temporarily halted shipments and sales of three car models made in Japan.
The scandals at the automakers are proving to be a sore point for the Japanese government, which has otherwise earned praise from investors and executives for its corporate reforms. Government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi called the misconduct “regrettable.”
Shares fall
Toyota said its wrongdoing had occurred during six different tests conducted in 2014, 2015, and 2020. The models affected were the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross, and discontinued versions of four popular models, including one sold under the Lexus luxury brand.
In one example, the company had measured collision damage on one side of a model’s hood while it was required to do so on both sides.
Toyota also said it is still investigating issues related to vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions, and aimed to complete that inquiry by the end of June.
It added that there were no performance issues that violated regulations and customers did not need to stop using their cars.
Toyota shares closed down 1.8%, in contrast to a 0.9% gain in the broad Topix index.
Mazda suspended shipments of its Roadster RF sports car and the Mazda2 hatchback from Thursday last week after finding that workers had modified engine control software test results, it said in a statement.
It also found that crash tests of the Atenza and Axela models, which are no longer in production, had been tampered with by using a timer to set off airbags during some frontal collision tests, instead of relying on an on-board sensor to detect a hit.
Mazda shares fell 3.3%.
Yamaha said it had halted shipments of a sports motorcycle.
Honda said it had found wrongdoing in noise and output tests over a period of more than eight years to October 2017 on some two dozen models that are no longer being produced.

Toyota remains world No.1 but its list of problems is growing

 — 
Toyota has retained its lead as the world’s biggest automaker by sales, beating German rival Volkswagen for the fourth consecutive year.
Despite the good news for Toyota (TM), it risks becoming bogged down in scandals over how it puts some of its cars through inspections, and continued fallout from a decades-old problem with exploding airbags.
The Japanese manufacturer said Tuesday it had sold a record 11.2 million vehicles worldwide in 2023, including its Daihatsu and Hino lineups. That represented an increase of 7.2% versus the previous year.
By comparison, Volkswagen Group announced earlier this month that it had delivered 9.2 million vehicles last year, up 12% compared to 2022.
The two have tussled for the title for years. In 2012, Toyota became the world’s top carmaker as it overtook General Motors in sales. Volkswagen later gained on the Japanese company, unseating Toyota in 2017.
In its Tuesday statement, Toyota attributed its growth to “solid demand in each region, in addition to easing semiconductor shortages.”
Sales in its home market of Japan surged 20.9%, while those overseas ticked up 4.1%.
Troubles at Toyota
But the Japanese behemoth may face an uphill battle this year as it grapples with growing concerns over the certifications of some of its vehicles.
On Monday, Toyota announced it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries.

Overall, 10 models use the affected engines globally, including the Land Cruiser 300 SUV and Hiace van, according to Toyota.
The company says it will now take measures to regain trust, including running new engine certification tests in the presence of regulators as needed.
The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota, halted domestic production after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.
Both scandals have raised serious questions for Toyota as a whole.
“We recognize the gravity of the fact that the repeated certification irregularities at [Toyota Industries], following those at Daihatsu, have shaken the very foundations of the company as an automobile manufacturer,” Toyota said in a Monday statement.
The group has also urged people to stop driving some of its cars in the United States and get them repaired immediately. Last week, Toyota warned owners of about 50,000 vehicles — including certain Corolla and RAV4 models dating back to 2003 — that parts of airbags could explode, causing serious injury or death.
Toyota has recalled tens of millions of cars in recent years over faulty Takata airbags. In December, Toyota also recalled about 1 million cars and SUVs in the United States due to a possible defect that could cause the passenger airbag to fail to deploy in a crash.
Growing competition
Volkswagen, too, saw growth in all regions last year, especially from Europe and North America. Deliveries in the two markets surged 19.7% and 17.9%, respectively.
China, which is the company’s biggest market, grew just 1.6%, with management citing a “challenging” environment.
Competition has become fiercer in China’s auto market — the world’s biggest — as homegrown manufacturers gain share and demand slows. Last year, Tesla (TSLA) cut prices in China to attract customers and stem slowing growth, triggering a price war that drew in dozens of automakers.
The battle has driven up sales, but threatened industry-wide profitability.

BYD has become the latest example of a company to see its bottom line affected. On Monday, the Chinese electric automaker said in a stock exchange filing that its net income likely rose by up to 86.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
While that is a sizeable increase, it represented a slowdown compared to the whopping 446% jump in profits recorded in 2022.
The news sent BYD shares down 4.4% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD has generated a lot of buzz lately after it surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) at the end of last year.
Legacy automakers are also racing to ramp up their sales of EVs. In 2023, Volkswagen logged a nearly 35% jump in sales of fully electric vehicles, selling 771,100 units.
That compared with 104,000 battery-powered vehicles sold by Toyota, which has long lagged behind in the global EV race. The company, which is a leader of hybrid cars, sold 3.7 million electric vehicles total in 2023 when including hybrids.

Toyota apologizes for cheating on vehicle testing and halts production of three models

TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda apologized Monday for massive cheating on certification tests for seven vehicle models as the automaker suspended production of three of them.
The wide-ranging fraudulent testing at Japan’s top automaker involved the use of inadequate or outdated data in collision tests, and incorrect testing of airbag inflation and rear-seat damage in crashes. Engine power tests were also found to have been falsified.
Toyota Motor Corp., based in Toyota city, central Japan, suspended production in the country of the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross. The deceptive tests were also found on discontinued models.
The company said the wrongdoing does not affect the safety of the vehicles already on roads, which include the Corolla subcompact and Lexus luxury vehicles.
“We sincerely apologize,” Toyoda told reporters, bowing deeply and holding the position for several seconds, as is customary in Japan at news conferences where companies apologize for misbehavior.
A Japanese government investigation into Toyota began in January. The issue does not affect Toyota’s overseas production.

Also Monday, Toyota’s Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp. reported similar irregular certification testing, and halted production of two models, the Roadster and Mazda 2. It said incorrect engine control software was used in the tests.
Mazda, based in the southwestern city of Hiroshima, also acknowledged violations on crash tests on three discontinued models. None of the violations affect the vehicles’ safety.
Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co. also apologized Monday for improper tests, such as those on noise levels and torque, on a range of models. Honda said affected older models — the Accord, Odyssey and Fit — are no longer in production. The safety of the vehicles is not affected, it said.
Certification problems starting surfacing two years ago at Toyota group companies, truck maker Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. — specializing in small models — and Toyota Industries Corp., which makes machinery and auto parts.
Shinji Miyamoto, a Toyota executive overseeing customer satisfaction, said Toyota began looking into its own tests following the problems at the group companies.
The apparent unraveling of the testing systems at Toyota and its group companies is an embarrassment for an automaker that’s prided itself for decades on production finesse and a corporate culture based on empowering workers to make “ever-better cars.”
Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, suggested some certification rules might be overly stringent, noting such tests differed around the world. But he repeatedly said he wasn’t condoning the violations.
“We are not a perfect company. But if we see anything wrong, we will take a step back and keep trying to correct it,” said Toyoda.
He said the company may have been too eager to get the tests done and abbreviated them at a time when model varieties were burgeoning.
Toyota sells more than 10 million vehicles around the world.

Toyota quality scandal widens as 10 models found to have rigged data
By Yuki Yamaguchi, KYODO NEWS - Jan 29, 2024 - 21:48 | All, Japan
 Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that power output data had been manipulated for 10 of its models sold globally, in a new blow to the world's biggest automaker group, which has been plagued by a series of quality control issues in recent years.
Its affiliate  Toyota Industries Corp. fabricated the data on diesel engines it makes and supplies for the automaker, Toyota said, adding that it will suspend shipment of the affected vehicles, including the Land Cruiser 300 and the Hilux.
"We sincerely apologize for causing tremendous trouble to our customers," Toyota President Koji Sato told reporters in Tokyo, adding the automaker will do all it can to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.
The revelation comes as a number of quality issues have been shaking the group's foundation.

Toyota's small-car unit Daihatsu Motor Co. stopped all shipments at home and abroad last month after a third-party investigation found that safety tests for most of its models were rigged.
Hino Motors Ltd., another Toyota subsidiary, admitted in March 2022 to submitting fraudulent emissions and fuel economy data to transport authorities.
The 10 models also include the Hiace, the Fortuner and the Innova. The cars were sold in Japan, Europe and the Middle East, among other markets. The output data rigging dates back to 2017, Toyota Industries said.
"We feel deeply responsible for the misconduct, which persisted for a long time, and for failing to discover and rectify it," Toyota Industries President Koichi Ito said at a press conference. "We will do our utmost to rebuild the company with legal compliance as our top priority."
Toyota has decided to stop six production lines at four of its domestic factories until Feb. 1 due to the shipment halt, it said.
Toyota Industries doctored the volume of fuel injection in engine output tests in a bid to make the engines' torque, or rotational force, appear better than it was, according to a report by a third-party panel.
The panel blamed the company's corporate culture, saying it lacked the will to actively increase compliance amid an environment where it felt secure in its position as a Toyota supplier.
"Its data compliance has grown lax," Hiroshi Inoue, the head of the panel, said at a separate press conference.
Toyota said it has confirmed the affected engines and that following a reevaluation after the discovery of the rigging, the vehicles now comply with engine output standards.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said the problem shakes the foundation of the automobile certification system, instructing Toyota Industries to find out the cause of the problem. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also said it will launch an on-site inspection at the company's factory in Aichi Prefecture on Tuesday.
Monday's announcement followed a revelation in March last year when Toyota Industries admitted to falsifying emissions data for its forklift engines. The third-party panel has been investigating the issue.
On Monday, Toyota Industries said the data rigging was found in more of its forklift  engines, and it has stopped shipment of all the affected products.

Toyota raided as safety testing scandal grows

The scandal involving Toyota has shaken up the Japanese car industry
Japan's transport ministry raided the headquarters of motor giant Toyota on Tuesday, as a scandal over faulty safety data escalated.
The world's largest carmaker has apologised for providing incorrect or manipulated data for safety certification tests.
The scandal has shaken the Japanese car industry, with rivals Honda, Mazda and Suzuki also admitting to submitting faulty data.
Toyota sold more than 11 million passenger vehicles in 2023.
It has said the findings do not affect the safety of vehicles already on the road.
The company has suspended the production of three car models - the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross.
It has also been accused of using modified vehicles during safety collision tests, for vehicles that are no longer in production.
The raids come a day after Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda apologised to customers and car enthusiasts.
He bowed deeply and held the position for a few seconds, which is customary in Japan when companies apologise for wrongdoing.
"We neglected the certification process and mass produced our cars without first taking the proper precautionary steps,” Mr Toyoda said.

Japanese carmakers Honda, Mazda and Suzuki are also due to be inspected by the authorities over the same issue.
Honda said it found wrongdoing on tests related to noise and engine power, but it has stressed that its vehicles are safe to drive.
Mazda has halted the shipments of some cars and said it will bear the cost to its suppliers.
However, the company added that it is not planning on issuing recalls.
The findings also apply to one Suzuki car model that is no longer being produced.
Last December, Toyota-owned carmaker Daihatsu closed all of its factories for more than a month, after admitting that it had falsified safety tests.
Some of the cars were sold with Toyota branding.
Daihatsu compensated more than 400 domestic suppliers during the period where its plants were idle.

Toyota halts some shipments as Japan’s auto safety scandal widens
By Reuters
3 minute read
Published 8:45 AM EDT, Mon June 3, 2024

Tokyo — A safety test scandal at Japanese automakers widened Monday, with Toyota Motor and Mazda both halting shipments of some vehicles after Japan’s transport ministry found irregularities in applications to certify certain models.
The irregularities were also found in applications from Honda (HMC), Suzuki and Yamaha Motor, the ministry said. The automakers were found to have submitted incorrect or manipulated safety test data when they applied for certification of the vehicles.
The ministry ordered Toyota (TM), the world’s biggest carmaker by the number of vehicles sold, Mazda and Yamaha to suspend shipments of some vehicles.
The latest revelations came after the ministry asked automakers in January to investigate certification applications following a safety test scandal at Toyota’s Daihatsu compact car unit that emerged last year.
Monday’s developments are also likely to heighten focus on Toyota’s annual general meeting later this month. Influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against re-electing Akio Toyoda as chairman at the meeting.
In a report to shareholders, ISS singled out the “spate of certification irregularities” at the Toyota Group.
Toyoda, the grandson of the automaker’s founder, told journalists Monday: “As the person in charge of the Toyota Group, I would like to sincerely apologize to our customers, to car fans, and all stakeholders for this.”
He said the cars had not gone through the correct certification process before being sold. Toyota said it had temporarily halted shipments and sales of three car models made in Japan.
The scandals at the automakers are proving to be a sore point for the Japanese government, which has otherwise earned praise from investors and executives for its corporate reforms. Government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi called the misconduct “regrettable.”
Shares fall
Toyota said its wrongdoing had occurred during six different tests conducted in 2014, 2015, and 2020. The models affected were the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross, and discontinued versions of four popular models, including one sold under the Lexus luxury brand.
In one example, the company had measured collision damage on one side of a model’s hood while it was required to do so on both sides.
Toyota also said it is still investigating issues related to vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions, and aimed to complete that inquiry by the end of June.
It added that there were no performance issues that violated regulations and customers did not need to stop using their cars.
Toyota shares closed down 1.8%, in contrast to a 0.9% gain in the broad Topix index.
Mazda suspended shipments of its Roadster RF sports car and the Mazda2 hatchback from Thursday last week after finding that workers had modified engine control software test results, it said in a statement.
It also found that crash tests of the Atenza and Axela models, which are no longer in production, had been tampered with by using a timer to set off airbags during some frontal collision tests, instead of relying on an on-board sensor to detect a hit.
Mazda shares fell 3.3%.
Yamaha said it had halted shipments of a sports motorcycle.
Honda said it had found wrongdoing in noise and output tests over a period of more than eight years to October 2017 on some two dozen models that are no longer being produced.

Toyota Begins Using "Self-sufficient" PET Bottle Recycling for New Land Cruiser "250"
"Self-sufficient" PET bottles reborn as seat fabric
As one approach to establishing a recycling-oriented society, we are promoting the use of recycled materials in car interiors. However, we are facing the challenges of price increases and shortages of PET bottles as a raw material.
Therefore, in a world first, we have started internally collecting PET bottles used by employees to have them reborn as recycled fibers for the new Land Cruiser "250" seat fabric.
By having employees wash, separate, and box the bottles themselves, we not only achieve self-sufficiency in procuring high-quality raw material, but we can also establish a circular system built on close cooperation between partner companies, such as recycling companies and fabric suppliers. Using recycled raw materials will allow us to reduce CO2 emissions by about 10% compared to conventional 100% petroleum-derived raw materials.
We continue to promote various initiatives on the path toward carbon neutrality, including using decarbonization technology for production processes and introducing recycling technology for car part reuse. Now, with the addition of recycled materials, we are changing the future of cars at the material level, as well!

Toyota Recognized as a White 500*1 enterprise under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program for the Seventh Consecutive Year and as a Sports Yell Company 2024+*2
To produce happiness for all, Toyota is committed to creating an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest. In line with its health-related philosophy and policy,*3 Toyota promotes strategic initiatives in collaboration with each workplace and affiliated company and makes constant improvements by reviewing each measure.
In recognition of these efforts, in March 2024, Toyota was recognized as a White 500 enterprise under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program (goal of recognizing over 500 organizations for positive policies), which is jointly implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Nippon Kenko Kaigi. This is the seventh consecutive year Toyota has been so recognized.
In addition, as part of its efforts to promote employee health, Toyota is working to provide exercise support to all employees to improve physical fitness and help prevent illness. Toyota was recognized by the Japan Sports Agency as a Sports Yell Company 2024+ for such efforts, which include daily workplace exercise practices, exercise habit awareness-raising through videos and apps, practical skills guidance according to physical fitness, and workplace sports events.
Toyota will continue these efforts to further promote health and productivity management based on the Declaration of Health Commitment by top management. The company recognizes that employees are valuable assets, that the physical and mental health of employees are driving forces behind its good performance, and that happiness for all employees is vital.

Toyota Will Stop Providing Paper Catalogs in Favor of Smart Catalogs From 2025
A meeting using a Smart Catalog
A Toyota dealership no longer using paper catalogs
Toyota will stop providing paper product catalogs in Japan from 2025 and promote the use of Smart Catalogs at Toyota dealerships nationwide.
We have been providing paper product catalogs for many years, but to further promote SDGs and carbon-neutral initiatives, we will stop producing and printing all paper catalogs for Toyota brand vehicles in January 2025.
Paper product catalogs use approximately 7,000 tons of paper annually and not only consume a large amount of forest resources but also create issues in manufacturing, transportation, storage, and disposal. We have been considering solutions. This change is predicted to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 11,000 tons annually (according to TOYOTA CONIQ Alpha, Inc. research).
In addition, we are gradually introducing Smart Catalogs through digital terminals at Toyota dealerships nationwide to offer customers an even more attractive car selection experience. These Smart Catalogs will use high-definition tablets to provide unique digital content, such as easy-to-understand vehicle feature introductions using video and computer graphics and the ability to compare multiple models side-by-side.
PDF versions of web catalogs will continue to be available on the Toyota product website (toyota.jp).
We will continue working to reduce the environmental impact of our entire supply chain, including at sales sites, and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality.

The Toyota Automobile Museum―established in 1989 by Toyota Motor Corporation to help build a prosperous future for both people and vehicles―considers the constant pursuit of sustainability a critical part of its mission. To further this cause, the museum introduced an exhibition series on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2021 titled "Let's Think About SDGs in Toyota Automobile Museum."
The inaugural exhibition gave an overview of SDGs, with the subsequent exhibition focused on carbon neutrality. The last of these, which started on August 1, 2023, and will continue until January 14, 2024, features various low-carbon vehicles powered by solar energy, electricity, biodiesel, and so on.
The idea behind these exhibitions is to accurately inform young people and children about the current state of society in general as well as problems closer to home, prompting them to take actions that contribute to a better future. In the activity area, many visitors―including families with small children―have taken the time to fill out a questionnaire and share what they are doing to help achieve the SDGs.
Staying true to its founding spirit, the Toyota Automobile Museum will keep contributing to a sustainable future.

Toyota has obtained "Shizen Kyosei Site"*1 certification from the Ministry of the Environment for contributing to the expansion of biodiversity conservation areas
As part of the Challenge to Establish a Future Society in Harmony with Nature, Toyota has been collaborating with diverse individuals in society to expand the circle of nature conservation and other activities promoting coexistence with nature from local communities to a global scale.
In December 2022, the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) adopted the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework with the common global goal to "halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a recovery track by 2030."
To achieve this goal, targets such as 30by30 have been established within this framework for each country to conserve 30% or more of their terrestrial and marine areas.
Toyota has joined the 30by30 Alliance for Biodiversity*2 to contribute to the achievement of the 30by30 goal in Japan through its ongoing efforts for nature conservation at various facilities. The four sites, namely Toyota Technical Center Shimoyama, Biotope Tsutsumi, Forest of Toyota, and Toyota Mie Miyagawa Forest, obtained certification as Shizen Kyosei Sites from the Ministry of the Environment in October 2023.
These sites will be registered in the World Database as OECMs*2.
We will continue to make the most of the technology and expertise we have accumulated through various businesses, aiming to achieve a sustainable society where humans and nature can coexist.

CSR: How Fortune 500 Companies Measure Up
Guest article by Vice President of Editorial Content, Kelly Seiz of Skytop Strategies
As previously published on Skytop Strategies
It is well documented that CSR practices are both an emerging and rapidly expanding set of standards for 21st century corporations. As $30 to $40 trillion shifts hands from the current generation to the upcoming millennials over the next few decades, there are markedly different standards that companies must uphold to gain traction in the evolving investor and consumer market.
A recent study finds that 69% of high-net millennials place greater worth in putting their money toward companies that show a high level of corporate social responsibility (CSR), even if they might sacrifice their return for the greater good. As a result of this growing trend, there is a greater variety in the options available—the number of SRI funds that apply a high level of CSR have exploded in one year from 200 in 2013 to over 900 in 2014 alone—over a 300% increase.
While Fortune 500 companies are ranked by their annual revenue, Skytop Strategies analyzed their CSR ratings using CSRHub to see how they measure up in terms of corporate social responsibility.
The companies listed on CSRHub are rated using a database of socially responsible investing research firms, indexes, publications, ranking systems, NGOs, crowd sources and government agencies. Five hundred data sources’ elements are aggregated, mapped to 12 subcategories, normalized, and weighted by a patented algorithm, to give ratings for the four following categories and averaged out to give an overall CSR rating.
The Community category covers the company’s commitment and effectiveness within the local, national and global community in which it does business, including products, human rights and supply chain, and giving back and philanthropy.
The Employees category includes disclosure of policies, programs, and performance in diversity, labor relations and labor rights, compensation, benefits, and employee training, health and safety.
The Environment category covers a company's interactions with the environment at large, including use of natural resources, energy and climate change, environmental policies and reporting, and a company’s impact on the Earth’s ecosystems.
The Governance category covers disclosure of policies and procedures, board independence and diversity, executive compensation, attention to stakeholder concerns, and evaluation of a company’s culture of ethical leadership and compliance.
We evaluated the highest and lowest rating companies by their overall CSR score and delved into the ratings to discover why they ranked as the best and worst when it comes to corporate social responsibility.
  Nationwide Financial Services Inc. ranked highest in both the Community and Environmental categories. The company has a long history in community engagement practices, including over 60 years of partnership with The American Red Cross and the Columbus Children’s Hospital. Their employees donate a total of nearly 16,000 units of blood annually, and Nationwide Financial Services provided a $100,000 Donation to Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program for Hurricane Matthew Relief. Nationwide has also partnered with Feeding America and donated 20 million meals over the course of 14 years.
In shareholder relations, ESG (environment, social, and corporate governance) and CSR efforts have proved to be valuable both in terms of brand value and company reputation. With over 33% growth in SRI investing over the past two years (SRI investing now accounts for more than $1 out of every $5 under professional management in the U.S.), corporate social, environmental and governance practices continue to gain relevance for investors and issuers alike.
New York Life Insurance Company ranked highest for Employees at 81 and Governance at 76. New York Life Insurance Company offers various educational programs for their employees, and is also well known for their inclusive policy toward employees of different backgrounds.

Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. holds the lowest Employee rating with 41, which falls in the bottom 9% in terms of the Fortune 500 Employee ranking. They have a record of 100 violations with OSHA, many of them repeat offenses. In 2015 Dollar Tree paid a total of $825,000 in fines for blocked emergency exits, and improper storage methods that were in danger of injuring employees.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds the lowest overall CSR rating, despite being listed fourth on the Fortune 500. “Berkshire has extremely low CSR scores across all subcategories,” Cynthia Figge, COO and Co-founder of CSRHub says. “They have 45 data sources, including all 13 of our major ESG analyst source databases, so this provides a strong signal of their perceived performance.”
Fortune Global 500 firms spend over $15 billion a year on corporate philanthropy, and Spearhead a wide variety of social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Forty-three percent of Fortune 500 companies have set renewable or sustainable energy targets, 22 of which have committed to powering all of their operations with renewable energy.
While Fortune 500 companies may maintain the highest total revenue, the varying CSR ratings of the top-ranking companies show that fiscal performance doesn’t necessarily factor in social and environmental value. Still, PwC’s 19th Annual Global CEO Survey showed that CEOs believe that over the next five years, the most successful organizations in their respective industries will incorporate both financial and non-financial matters in reporting, have investors seeking ethical investments, make corporate responsibility core to the company, and that top talent will prefer to work for organizations with social values aligned to their own.
Beyond the bottom line, socially responsible corporations may sacrifice higher revenue to maintain brand value and reputability, which, given the shift in investor preference, may lead us to see a very different Fortune 500 list in the coming years.

Sustainability Ratings on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) from CSRHUB
A new source of sustainability and CSR information
PUBLISHED 09-09-10
SUBMITTED BY CSRHUB
CSRHUB LLC announced today that CSRHUB has released the beta version of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) rating tool. The CSRHUB web site, at http://www.csrhub.com, now offers free ratings on the environmental, community, labor, and governance performance for more than 5,000 companies from 66 countries and across 135 industries. Based on feedback from an extensive alpha test period, CSRHUB has improved its user interface, refined its ratings, and added both CSR-related news and job content. The site is built on data from more than 90 sources, and contains more than 2 million pieces of data. CSRHUB offers basic ratings information for free and then additional rating details to those who subscribe.

CSRHUB's ratings allow corporate branding, PR, and sustainability managers, consumer activists, foundations and non-governmental organizations, researchers, and reporters to understand and compare the sustainability performance of almost all of the world's major corporations. CSRHUB users get an unprecedented amount of information and transparent access to most of the world's major sources of CSR information. CSRHUB ratings are built on information supplied by respected environmental, social, governance (ESG) ratings analysts including ASSET4, GovernanceMetrics International, IW Financial, Trucost and Vigeo, as well as from a wide variety of public and non-profit sources on social justice and environmental sustainability. No other source to date has offered so much information at such a reasonable price.

"We have received a tremendous amount of alpha-stage input on our CSRHUB project from sustainability professionals, NGOs, and activist consumers who are concerned about social issues," said CSRHUB CEO and Co-Founder Bahar Gidwani. "They have told us that our site will help them analyze branding, marketing, business partnership and supply chain decisions. We expect to also help activists and individuals make decisions about what to buy and who to work for," said Gidwani.

Rather than setting a single standard for CSR performance, CSRHUB enables its users to create a profile of their own values. The site then tailors its company performance ratings to the individual user's values. The site links transparently to its sources, so that users can see the original data behind the ratings. CSRHUB works with a number of social media and not-for-profits, including Climate Counts, CSRwire, WikiPositive, TriplePundit, and Sustainable Life Media to provide rich and deep coverage of CSR issues.

Co-founder and COO Cynthia Figge adds that, "CSRHUB provides a rating system that provides greater transparency on the progress companies have made in building sustainable organizations. In addition, CSRHUB ratings offer business people and consumers a free, comprehensive, searchable database that reveals the social and environmental performance of companies, giving public access to ratings data that has not been available before."

CSRHub - What's Changed After Ten Years of CSR Ratings: Part Two
Part 2 of a 2-part series.
In 2008 CSRHub began measuring performance in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using ten years of history, we are now starting to answer questions such as: 
Has CSR performance improved over time?
What area of CSR is improving the most?
Is the universe of companies for which ratings are available expanding beyond the large public corporations?
How strong is the alignment between CSR performance and company CSR reporting on CSR?
  More Data on More Companies
A dramatic increase in ratings sources beyond Wall Street-driven and research companies has expanded the field of companies for which ratings can be developed.  For example, the number of companies and other entities studied by CSRHub has increased from 2,000 in 2008 to 18,000 in 2018. In 2008, the major sources of data were the analyst research houses which covered only large public companies. While this data produces rich consistent opinion matrices and remains a vital component of the CSRHub system, other crowd sources, not-for-profit groups, publications, and government regulators helped expand the covered universe to include smaller companies, not-for-profit organizations, and government entities.
    Still a Disconnect Between Reporting and Performance
One of the reasons we developed CSRHub was because we felt there was a disconnect between reporting (what companies said about themselves) and performance (what companies actually do).  We could not find a way to pierce the veil and determine performance directly.  This is why we created a proxy based on the aggregate opinion of how a company is performing on ESG (environment, social, governance) issues, from a wide range of expert sources.  Our scores build a feedback loop so that companies can see how their performance and reporting are perceived.  We hope they will use this feedback to improve both the truth about their corporate social behavior and what they tell their stakeholders about themselves.
We recently launched a new tool in partnership with Bloomberg that illustrates clearly that reporting and performance are still only loosely related.  The chart below shows for the S&P 100 a measure of disclosure (the horizontal axis is the percent of Bloomberg’s 900 sustainability indicators that have been captured for each company) against a measure of perceived sustainability performance (CSRHub’s overall rating).  The correlation between these measures is only 28%.  This indicates that there must be other “explanatory variables” that drive how a company’s ESG performance is perceived, besides the extent of its sustainability disclosures.
    Looking Ahead at CSR Trends
We don’t expect to see many major new analyst-driven sources of ESG data emerge.  It is expensive and time-consuming to use human analysts to review and weigh a company’s sustainability performance.  We’ve seen new data sets that are driven by news reports, tweets, or other bottoms up evidence.  These sets are interesting, but we have not seen much correlation between them and the many other sources we review.  There are many new sources of data coming from not-for-profit groups—especially those who have focused on supply chain issues.  We also expect government-regulation-driven disclosures to expose more small and mid-size companies—especially in Europe and parts of Asia.
Our big data-driven system seems to be working well and producing useful insights into the relative sustainability performance of thousands of companies.  We plan to continue growing our coverage and tying the signals from our data to tools that can be used by companies, analysts, activists and researchers around the world.
With the exception of the still-broad gap between disclosure and performance metrics, CSR has moved forward over the last ten years.  CSRHub will continue to track the change in emphasis on core issues and incorporate new data sets as they emerge. What gets measured – and reported – is what gets implemented.  We’ll keep working to help keep CSR moving forward for the next ten years.

Toyota Begins Using "Self-sufficient" PET Bottle Recycling for New Land Cruiser "250"
"Self-sufficient" PET bottles reborn as seat fabric
As one approach to establishing a recycling-oriented society, we are promoting the use of recycled materials in car interiors. However, we are facing the challenges of price increases and shortages of PET bottles as a raw material.
Therefore, in a world first, we have started internally collecting PET bottles used by employees to have them reborn as recycled fibers for the new Land Cruiser "250" seat fabric.
By having employees wash, separate, and box the bottles themselves, we not only achieve self-sufficiency in procuring high-quality raw material, but we can also establish a circular system built on close cooperation between partner companies, such as recycling companies and fabric suppliers. Using recycled raw materials will allow us to reduce CO2 emissions by about 10% compared to conventional 100% petroleum-derived raw materials.
We continue to promote various initiatives on the path toward carbon neutrality, including using decarbonization technology for production processes and introducing recycling technology for car part reuse. Now, with the addition of recycled materials, we are changing the future of cars at the material level, as well!

Toyota Recognized as a White 500*1 enterprise under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program for the Seventh Consecutive Year and as a Sports Yell Company 2024+*2
To produce happiness for all, Toyota is committed to creating an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest. In line with its health-related philosophy and policy,*3 Toyota promotes strategic initiatives in collaboration with each workplace and affiliated company and makes constant improvements by reviewing each measure.
In recognition of these efforts, in March 2024, Toyota was recognized as a White 500 enterprise under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program (goal of recognizing over 500 organizations for positive policies), which is jointly implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Nippon Kenko Kaigi. This is the seventh consecutive year Toyota has been so recognized.
In addition, as part of its efforts to promote employee health, Toyota is working to provide exercise support to all employees to improve physical fitness and help prevent illness. Toyota was recognized by the Japan Sports Agency as a Sports Yell Company 2024+ for such efforts, which include daily workplace exercise practices, exercise habit awareness-raising through videos and apps, practical skills guidance according to physical fitness, and workplace sports events.
Toyota will continue these efforts to further promote health and productivity management based on the Declaration of Health Commitment by top management. The company recognizes that employees are valuable assets, that the physical and mental health of employees are driving forces behind its good performance, and that happiness for all employees is vital.

Toyota Will Stop Providing Paper Catalogs in Favor of Smart Catalogs From 2025
A meeting using a Smart Catalog
A Toyota dealership no longer using paper catalogs
Toyota will stop providing paper product catalogs in Japan from 2025 and promote the use of Smart Catalogs at Toyota dealerships nationwide.
We have been providing paper product catalogs for many years, but to further promote SDGs and carbon-neutral initiatives, we will stop producing and printing all paper catalogs for Toyota brand vehicles in January 2025.
Paper product catalogs use approximately 7,000 tons of paper annually and not only consume a large amount of forest resources but also create issues in manufacturing, transportation, storage, and disposal. We have been considering solutions. This change is predicted to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 11,000 tons annually (according to TOYOTA CONIQ Alpha, Inc. research).
In addition, we are gradually introducing Smart Catalogs through digital terminals at Toyota dealerships nationwide to offer customers an even more attractive car selection experience. These Smart Catalogs will use high-definition tablets to provide unique digital content, such as easy-to-understand vehicle feature introductions using video and computer graphics and the ability to compare multiple models side-by-side.
PDF versions of web catalogs will continue to be available on the Toyota product website (toyota.jp).
We will continue working to reduce the environmental impact of our entire supply chain, including at sales sites, and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality.

The Toyota Automobile Museum Holds a Series of SDG Exhibitions
2021 Exhibition
2023 Exhibition (featuring the solar-powered Toyota RaRa II)
The Toyota Automobile Museum―established in 1989 by Toyota Motor Corporation to help build a prosperous future for both people and vehicles―considers the constant pursuit of sustainability a critical part of its mission. To further this cause, the museum introduced an exhibition series on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2021 titled "Let's Think About SDGs in Toyota Automobile Museum."
The inaugural exhibition gave an overview of SDGs, with the subsequent exhibition focused on carbon neutrality. The last of these, which started on August 1, 2023, and will continue until January 14, 2024, features various low-carbon vehicles powered by solar energy, electricity, biodiesel, and so on.
The idea behind these exhibitions is to accurately inform young people and children about the current state of society in general as well as problems closer to home, prompting them to take actions that contribute to a better future. In the activity area, many visitors―including families with small children―have taken the time to fill out a questionnaire and share what they are doing to help achieve the SDGs.
Staying true to its founding spirit, the Toyota Automobile Museum will keep contributing to a sustainable future.

Toyota has obtained "Shizen Kyosei Site"*1 certification from the Ministry of the Environment for contributing to the expansion of biodiversity conservation areas
As part of the Challenge to Establish a Future Society in Harmony with Nature, Toyota has been collaborating with diverse individuals in society to expand the circle of nature conservation and other activities promoting coexistence with nature from local communities to a global scale.
In December 2022, the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) adopted the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework with the common global goal to "halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a recovery track by 2030."
To achieve this goal, targets such as 30by30 have been established within this framework for each country to conserve 30% or more of their terrestrial and marine areas.
Toyota has joined the 30by30 Alliance for Biodiversity*2 to contribute to the achievement of the 30by30 goal in Japan through its ongoing efforts for nature conservation at various facilities. The four sites, namely Toyota Technical Center Shimoyama, Biotope Tsutsumi, Forest of Toyota, and Toyota Mie Miyagawa Forest, obtained certification as Shizen Kyosei Sites from the Ministry of the Environment in October 2023.
These sites will be registered in the World Database as OECMs*2.
We will continue to make the most of the technology and expertise we have accumulated through various businesses, aiming to achieve a sustainable society where humans and nature can coexist.

CSR: How Fortune 500 Companies Measure Up
Guest article by Vice President of Editorial Content, Kelly Seiz of Skytop Strategies
As previously published on Skytop Strategies
It is well documented that CSR practices are both an emerging and rapidly expanding set of standards for 21st century corporations. As $30 to $40 trillion shifts hands from the current generation to the upcoming millennials over the next few decades, there are markedly different standards that companies must uphold to gain traction in the evolving investor and consumer market.
A recent study finds that 69% of high-net millennials place greater worth in putting their money toward companies that show a high level of corporate social responsibility (CSR), even if they might sacrifice their return for the greater good. As a result of this growing trend, there is a greater variety in the options available—the number of SRI funds that apply a high level of CSR have exploded in one year from 200 in 2013 to over 900 in 2014 alone—over a 300% increase.
While Fortune 500 companies are ranked by their annual revenue, Skytop Strategies analyzed their CSR ratings using CSRHub to see how they measure up in terms of corporate social responsibility.
The companies listed on CSRHub are rated using a database of socially responsible investing research firms, indexes, publications, ranking systems, NGOs, crowd sources and government agencies. Five hundred data sources’ elements are aggregated, mapped to 12 subcategories, normalized, and weighted by a patented algorithm, to give ratings for the four following categories and averaged out to give an overall CSR rating.
The Community category covers the company’s commitment and effectiveness within the local, national and global community in which it does business, including products, human rights and supply chain, and giving back and philanthropy.
The Employees category includes disclosure of policies, programs, and performance in diversity, labor relations and labor rights, compensation, benefits, and employee training, health and safety.
The Environment category covers a company's interactions with the environment at large, including use of natural resources, energy and climate change, environmental policies and reporting, and a company’s impact on the Earth’s ecosystems.
The Governance category covers disclosure of policies and procedures, board independence and diversity, executive compensation, attention to stakeholder concerns, and evaluation of a company’s culture of ethical leadership and compliance.
We evaluated the highest and lowest rating companies by their overall CSR score and delved into the ratings to discover why they ranked as the best and worst when it comes to corporate social responsibility.
  Nationwide Financial Services Inc. ranked highest in both the Community and Environmental categories. The company has a long history in community engagement practices, including over 60 years of partnership with The American Red Cross and the Columbus Children’s Hospital. Their employees donate a total of nearly 16,000 units of blood annually, and Nationwide Financial Services provided a $100,000 Donation to Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program for Hurricane Matthew Relief. Nationwide has also partnered with Feeding America and donated 20 million meals over the course of 14 years.
In shareholder relations, ESG (environment, social, and corporate governance) and CSR efforts have proved to be valuable both in terms of brand value and company reputation. With over 33% growth in SRI investing over the past two years (SRI investing now accounts for more than $1 out of every $5 under professional management in the U.S.), corporate social, environmental and governance practices continue to gain relevance for investors and issuers alike.
New York Life Insurance Company ranked highest for Employees at 81 and Governance at 76. New York Life Insurance Company offers various educational programs for their employees, and is also well known for their inclusive policy toward employees of different backgrounds.

Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. holds the lowest Employee rating with 41, which falls in the bottom 9% in terms of the Fortune 500 Employee ranking. They have a record of 100 violations with OSHA, many of them repeat offenses. In 2015 Dollar Tree paid a total of $825,000 in fines for blocked emergency exits, and improper storage methods that were in danger of injuring employees.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds the lowest overall CSR rating, despite being listed fourth on the Fortune 500. “Berkshire has extremely low CSR scores across all subcategories,” Cynthia Figge, COO and Co-founder of CSRHub says. “They have 45 data sources, including all 13 of our major ESG analyst source databases, so this provides a strong signal of their perceived performance.”
Fortune Global 500 firms spend over $15 billion a year on corporate philanthropy, and Spearhead a wide variety of social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Forty-three percent of Fortune 500 companies have set renewable or sustainable energy targets, 22 of which have committed to powering all of their operations with renewable energy.
While Fortune 500 companies may maintain the highest total revenue, the varying CSR ratings of the top-ranking companies show that fiscal performance doesn’t necessarily factor in social and environmental value. Still, PwC’s 19th Annual Global CEO Survey showed that CEOs believe that over the next five years, the most successful organizations in their respective industries will incorporate both financial and non-financial matters in reporting, have investors seeking ethical investments, make corporate responsibility core to the company, and that top talent will prefer to work for organizations with social values aligned to their own.
Beyond the bottom line, socially responsible corporations may sacrifice higher revenue to maintain brand value and reputability, which, given the shift in investor preference, may lead us to see a very different Fortune 500 list in the coming years.

Sustainability Ratings On Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) From CSRHUB

Sustainability Ratings on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) from CSRHUB
A new source of sustainability and CSR information
PUBLISHED 09-09-10
SUBMITTED BY CSRHUB
CSRHUB LLC announced today that CSRHUB has released the beta version of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) rating tool. The CSRHUB web site, at http://www.csrhub.com, now offers free ratings on the environmental, community, labor, and governance performance for more than 5,000 companies from 66 countries and across 135 industries. Based on feedback from an extensive alpha test period, CSRHUB has improved its user interface, refined its ratings, and added both CSR-related news and job content. The site is built on data from more than 90 sources, and contains more than 2 million pieces of data. CSRHUB offers basic ratings information for free and then additional rating details to those who subscribe.

CSRHUB's ratings allow corporate branding, PR, and sustainability managers, consumer activists, foundations and non-governmental organizations, researchers, and reporters to understand and compare the sustainability performance of almost all of the world's major corporations. CSRHUB users get an unprecedented amount of information and transparent access to most of the world's major sources of CSR information. CSRHUB ratings are built on information supplied by respected environmental, social, governance (ESG) ratings analysts including ASSET4, GovernanceMetrics International, IW Financial, Trucost and Vigeo, as well as from a wide variety of public and non-profit sources on social justice and environmental sustainability. No other source to date has offered so much information at such a reasonable price.

"We have received a tremendous amount of alpha-stage input on our CSRHUB project from sustainability professionals, NGOs, and activist consumers who are concerned about social issues," said CSRHUB CEO and Co-Founder Bahar Gidwani. "They have told us that our site will help them analyze branding, marketing, business partnership and supply chain decisions. We expect to also help activists and individuals make decisions about what to buy and who to work for," said Gidwani.

Rather than setting a single standard for CSR performance, CSRHUB enables its users to create a profile of their own values. The site then tailors its company performance ratings to the individual user's values. The site links transparently to its sources, so that users can see the original data behind the ratings. CSRHUB works with a number of social media and not-for-profits, including Climate Counts, CSRwire, WikiPositive, TriplePundit, and Sustainable Life Media to provide rich and deep coverage of CSR issues.

Co-founder and COO Cynthia Figge adds that, "CSRHUB provides a rating system that provides greater transparency on the progress companies have made in building sustainable organizations. In addition, CSRHUB ratings offer business people and consumers a free, comprehensive, searchable database that reveals the social and environmental performance of companies, giving public access to ratings data that has not been available before."

CSRHub - What's Changed After Ten Years of CSR Ratings: Part Two
Part 2 of a 2-part series.
In 2008 CSRHub began measuring performance in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using ten years of history, we are now starting to answer questions such as: 
Has CSR performance improved over time?
What area of CSR is improving the most?
Is the universe of companies for which ratings are available expanding beyond the large public corporations?
How strong is the alignment between CSR performance and company CSR reporting on CSR?
  More Data on More Companies
A dramatic increase in ratings sources beyond Wall Street-driven and research companies has expanded the field of companies for which ratings can be developed.  For example, the number of companies and other entities studied by CSRHub has increased from 2,000 in 2008 to 18,000 in 2018. In 2008, the major sources of data were the analyst research houses which covered only large public companies. While this data produces rich consistent opinion matrices and remains a vital component of the CSRHub system, other crowd sources, not-for-profit groups, publications, and government regulators helped expand the covered universe to include smaller companies, not-for-profit organizations, and government entities.
    Still a Disconnect Between Reporting and Performance
One of the reasons we developed CSRHub was because we felt there was a disconnect between reporting (what companies said about themselves) and performance (what companies actually do).  We could not find a way to pierce the veil and determine performance directly.  This is why we created a proxy based on the aggregate opinion of how a company is performing on ESG (environment, social, governance) issues, from a wide range of expert sources.  Our scores build a feedback loop so that companies can see how their performance and reporting are perceived.  We hope they will use this feedback to improve both the truth about their corporate social behavior and what they tell their stakeholders about themselves.
We recently launched a new tool in partnership with Bloomberg that illustrates clearly that reporting and performance are still only loosely related.  The chart below shows for the S&P 100 a measure of disclosure (the horizontal axis is the percent of Bloomberg’s 900 sustainability indicators that have been captured for each company) against a measure of perceived sustainability performance (CSRHub’s overall rating).  The correlation between these measures is only 28%.  This indicates that there must be other “explanatory variables” that drive how a company’s ESG performance is perceived, besides the extent of its sustainability disclosures.
    Looking Ahead at CSR Trends
We don’t expect to see many major new analyst-driven sources of ESG data emerge.  It is expensive and time-consuming to use human analysts to review and weigh a company’s sustainability performance.  We’ve seen new data sets that are driven by news reports, tweets, or other bottoms up evidence.  These sets are interesting, but we have not seen much correlation between them and the many other sources we review.  There are many new sources of data coming from not-for-profit groups—especially those who have focused on supply chain issues.  We also expect government-regulation-driven disclosures to expose more small and mid-size companies—especially in Europe and parts of Asia.
Our big data-driven system seems to be working well and producing useful insights into the relative sustainability performance of thousands of companies.  We plan to continue growing our coverage and tying the signals from our data to tools that can be used by companies, analysts, activists and researchers around the world.
With the exception of the still-broad gap between disclosure and performance metrics, CSR has moved forward over the last ten years.  CSRHub will continue to track the change in emphasis on core issues and incorporate new data sets as they emerge. What gets measured – and reported – is what gets implemented.  We’ll keep working to help keep CSR moving forward for the next ten years.
