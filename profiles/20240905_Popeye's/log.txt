Susan: To gather comprehensive information on Popeye's, the research strategy should include the following steps:

1. **Company Overview**: You can start by investigating Popeye's publicly available information such as the company history, size, location, etc. Company websites, Wikipedia, and online business databases like Bloomberg or Yahoo Finance can provide this information.

2. **Financial Information**: To gather financial data, check publicly available financial statements, annual reports, press releases, or any investor relations notifications on Popeye's parent company, Restaurant Brands International's website. We can also analyze company stock performance through financial news sites such as Forbes, Business Insider or Financial Times.

3. **Key Decision Makers**: LinkedIn profiles, news interviews, and company team pages might reveal information about key decision makers, including the CEO, CFO, and board members. Looking at their backgrounds, we can identify if they have any common interests, or personal information that could potentially be used as leverage points. 

4. **Labor Relations & Scandals**: Investigate news articles, press releases and social media sites for any labor issues or scandals. Try to understand previous and ongoing labor issues, the firm's response to them, and public reaction. Search for any lawsuits or accusations related to employee treatment, working conditions, or wage disputes by using news search engines like Google News or more specialized sources like Employment Law Daily.

5. **Industry Trends**: By examining the business news and market analytics platforms, we can understand the fast food industry trends and Popeye's position in them. This information can present additional leverage points.

6. **Employee Reviews**: Websites like Glassdoor or Indeed offer reviews from employees about the company culture, management style, and working conditions, which could offer leverage points.

7. **Social Media Monitoring**: Keep track of Popeye's social media activities, as it can provide additional insight into its brand image, products, customer feedbacks/complaints, marketing strategies and more.

8. **Regulatory Environment**: Check for any new or existing laws, regulations, or government policy changes that might impact Popeye's. Government websites and specialized legal databases could help in this regard.

Compare and cross-verify the obtained data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and updated information.
