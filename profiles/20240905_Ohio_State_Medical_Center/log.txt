Susan: Here's a suggested approach to gather information on the topic:

1. **General Information Gathering**: Start your search by browsing the official website of the Ohio State Medical Center. They typically provide valuable information about the organization, its mission, departments, leadership, and contact information. 

2. **Financial Information**: Financial data about Ohio State Medical Center can be obtained from public records, annual reports, tax filings, or websites dedicated to financial data sharing. For non-profit entities, check if their 990 forms are available on websites like ProPublica. Also, look for recently published financial articles or news related to the medical center.

3. **Key Decision Makers**: Identify the key decision makers by looking at the "leadership" or "our team" section of the hospital’s website. Also, check professional networking websites such as LinkedIn for more detailed profiles of these individuals. Additionally, newspaper articles, press releases, and financial reports might mention the names and roles of key decision makers

4. **Possible Leverage Points**: Look at online articles, news, blogs, and social media feeds regarding the key decision makers. This will provide insights into their positions on issues, past actions, areas of interest, and potential points of leverage.

5. **Labor Relations**: Research local news outlets, union websites, and labor relation boards. See if there are any recent disputes, strikes, or negotiations that have happened at the hospital. Look for trends in how the hospital has dealt with unions and workers in the past. 

6. **Recent Scandals**: Check news websites, social media feeds, and the hospital's own publications for any recent scandals. For this, using specific search terms like the hospital's name plus "controversy", "scandal", "lawsuit", or "complaint" could prove useful.

7. **Additional Points of Leverage**: OSDH violations, lawsuits, negative patient reviews, and low ratings can be another point of leverage. Keep an eye out for negative sentiments, reviews or complaints about the hospital from patients, employees, or the public.

Remember, it's crucial to stay organized during the process. Use a spreadsheet or a similar system to keep your findings categorized and easily accessible.

Manny: Here are a few follow-up questions for Susan:

1. **General Information Gathering**: Susan, where can we find official documents like meeting minutes or public disclosures?
   
2. **Financial Information**: Can you recommend any specific financial databases or sources we should look into?

3. **Key Decision Makers**: How can we look into their previous roles or professional history? Any specific platforms you recommend?

4. **Possible Leverage Points**: What kind of data points should we be looking for that would constitute as leverage points?

5. **Labor Relations**: Are there typically public records for disputes, strikes or negotiations?

6. **Recent Scandals**: What are some reliable news sources that you would recommend for this task?

7. **Additional Points of Leverage**: Where can we find information about OSDH violations or lawsuits lodged against a medical institution? 

Smoothing the Process: Susan, any tips or tools you recommend to streamline this research process and ensure we don't miss key information?
