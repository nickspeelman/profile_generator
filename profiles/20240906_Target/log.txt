Susan: Certainly, here are the steps we can follow:

1. **Company Website:** We will start with the official website of Target. The site can provide substantial information about the company including its latest financial reports, news, and identifying decision makers via an 'About Us' or 'Leadership' page.

2. **Financial Performance:** Next, we can check financial websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Bloomberg etc. for Target’s financial data such as earnings statements and balance sheets. 

3. **Decision Makers:** Key decision makers can be identified through the company’s website, but also by news articles, interviews and profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. Google search on each of these decision makers can provide additional insights regarding their professional background and possible points of leverage.

4. **Labor Relations:** We need to research on worker's issues and labor relations related to Target. This can be done by checking labor rights websites, union websites, news articles or relevant government websites. Key topics to investigate would be about wages, working conditions, worker benefits, and union activity.

5. **Scandals and Legal Issues:** Any recent scandals or lawsuits can also become points of leverage. Researching through news archives on reputable sites such as The Guardian, The New York Times, etc. and legal databases can help find any such news in recent years.

6. **Online Presence:** The company's social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn could hold a plethora of information, including customer reviews, any praiseworthy or problematic conduct, and responses to recent events or scandals.

7. **Comments and Reviews:** Online forums and review websites such as Glassdoor or Indeed can provide valuable insights into the experiences of current and past employees.

8. **Corporate Responsibility:** Research the company's corporate social responsibility initiatives and community involvement, as these could provide additional points of leverage.

After gathering all the relevant data, we must compile it into a comprehensive research brief, identifying the company's financial standing, key decision makers and their leverage points, labor relations status, recent scandals, and other possible points of leverage.
