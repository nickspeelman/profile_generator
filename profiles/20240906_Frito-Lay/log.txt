Susan: Sure. Here's a strategy for gathering information on Frito-Lay:

**1. Financial Information:**
For financial data, sources like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Forbes, and the Wall Street Journal can provide useful information. Search these websites for quarterly/half-yearly/annual revenue reports, profits, investments, debts, and other financial details of the company. Frito-Lay is a division of PepsiCo, so look for the financial subdivision of the company in PepsiCo's annual reports.

**2. Key Decision Makers:**
For information on key decision makers, start with Frito-Lay's official website and go to their “About Us” or “Leadership” section. You can find detailed bios of top executives on the company's own website or on business-focused social media platforms like LinkedIn. Identifying these individuals will give us a starting point to investigate any potential points of leverage.

**3. Labor Relations:**
Examine Frito-Lay's or PepsiCo's official reports, press releases, direct statements and policies regarding labor management for initial insight. Beyond that, news websites like Business Insider, The New York Times and the Washington Post occasionally provide coverage on labor issues. Labor-related online forums, blogs and sites like Glassdoor can also provide workers' sentiment towards their employer.

**4. Recent Scandals:**
A Google search can reveal recent scandals or problematic PR incidents associated with Frito-Lay. Scandals often get covered by news agencies or discussed in forums, so websites like Reddit could be of use as well.

**5. Other Leverage Points:**
To find other potential points of leverage, delve into topics like environmental impact, corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, involvement in community outreach programs, major lawsuits or legal actions, lobbying activities and other ethical considerations. Review recent company actions with a critical eye for areas where they might be vulnerable to criticism or pressure.

**6. Tools for Tracking:** 
Use Google's News Alert feature to stay updated on new information about Frito-Lay, noting any patterns or repeated issues that may signal systemic problems in the company. Using an RSS feed to keep track of various news outlets can also be helpful.

Remember to document, organize, and analyze your findings in your briefs.
